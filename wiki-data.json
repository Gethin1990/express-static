Use this approach if you want to use the camera in an area, that does not provide a network infrastructure or to if you want to configure the camera to connect to a Wifi network when you don´t have a LAN Ethernet connection available to make the initial Wifi configuration. Connect the Camera Connect the camera with a regular Ethernet cable to your PC or Notebook(Very old PCs might still need a special - Crossover - cable to make this connections). Search the Camera Install/Open the INSTAR Camera Tool which will show you the following message after clicking the ''Search'' button:(you might have to select the correct network interface to which the camera is connected to. If for example you have a VPN connection, an active bluetooth module and the regular LAN interface, then you have to select the LAN interface in order to find your IP camera. Open the camera tool and press Search. Assign a static IP to your Windows PC Open the Network- and Sharing Centre(Control Panel ->Network and Security). The interface will show you a new unidentified LAN connection. Open it´s settings by clicking Local Area Network. Go to Properties, select the Internet Protocol Version 4(TCP/IPv4) and select Properties as shown below. Open the Windows Network- and Sharing Centre and go to the LAN adapter properties. The following window will open and allow you to set a static IP address for your PC/Laptop. Submit the settings by clicking OK and return to the IP Camera Tool. Open the IPv4 properties. Please fill in a valid IP address for your computer and set it to be new networks gateway and DNS server(see below):Assign a static IP address to your PC. Assign a static IP to your Mac Open the menu System Preferences go to Network and click on Ethernet. Please choose Configure IPv4:Manually and type in a valid IP address. Use the same IP address as the Router IP. Submit the new settings with Apply and return to the IP Camera Tool. Go to the Sytem Preferences and open the Ethernet configuration. Assign a static IP to your Camera Click on ''IP Config'' and select your camera on the left side. Fill in the IP address for the camera. The address has to be in the same IP subnet you used for your computer in '''step 3''' but has to be different from the address you choose above - e.g. '''just add 1''' to the last octet(see example below)!The Gateway and DNS server will be the IP address of your computer that you set above. If you are using a class C network the standard subnet mask is(Subnet Mask:255.255.255.0). Open the IP configuration tab of the INSTAR camera tool and set a valid IP address and submit. After submitting the data the camera will restart which takes about 30 seconds. Click on Search to find the camera again and double-click die camera entry to open the WebUI inside your default browser. If you want to use a different browser, type in the camera´s IP address into your browser´s address line and press Return. You are now able to change the camera´s settings and access the live stream. Open the camera´s new IP address with your default browser. If you choose the direct connection to do the initial WLAN configuration of your camera to integrate it into an existing Wifi network, type in the WLAN information under Network/WIFi and change the cameras IP address to a free address in the IP subnet that is used inside the wireless network. The camera will then restart - please unplug the LAN cable right after submitting the new IP address to allow the camera to connect to your wireless LAN.","link":"/Quick_Installation/Direct_LAN_Connection","title2": "Direkte Verbindung mit einem PC oder Notebook","chapter": "Quick Installation","tags":["Introduction", "Quickinstallation", "Network"],"image": "http://placehold.it/594x380","abstract": "Direct Connection between your Computer and your Camera","suggest" : {"input": [ "direct", "connection", "ethernet", "lan cable" ],"output": "Direct LAN Cable Connection","payload" : { "articleId" : 1004 },"weight" : 10}}

It is cross-platform and lightweight. Not requiring any installations, it can be freely copied and used anywhere. Angry IP scanner simply pings each IP address to check if it’s alive, then optionally it is resolving its hostname, determines the MAC address, scans ports, etc. Alternative IP Scanner How to find your IP Camera in the network with an alternative IP Scanner The IP Camera Tool(Windows), IP Camera Tool(MacOSX) or IP Camera Tool(Linux) is for sure the most comfortable way to find your IP camera inside your network. Instructions on how to set up your INSTAR IP camera with the Camera Tool can be found here. If, for some reason, the IP Camera Tool does not work on your computer, here are a few other options to discover the IP address. The camera will try to receive an IP address automatically(DHCP) during the first installation. Most routers will give you a log file of fresh DHCP requests, in which you should be able to find the camera´s IP address. You should reach the cameras login portal by typing this address into the web browser´s address bar. If you do not have access to your router or if your router does not have any log files please refer to alternative IP scanners - an examples is:Angry IP Scanner(Windows/MacOSX/Linux) You can find the newest Version here for Windows/MacOSX/Linux - install and start the application, type in the IP range and start the search. Please fill out the field IP Range with the IP range that your router´s DHCP service is set to. If you do not know the IP range, then simply use the command line on Windows, type in ipconfig and check your computers IPv4 address(see screenshot below). Use this IP address in Angry IP Scanner and just change the last octet to 1 for the start IP address and 254 for the last IP address to search the complete /24 subnet. Make sure your camera is disconnected from your network and then press Start to begin the scan. You can use the ipconfig command to confirm the IP range of your network. The scanner will now display all active devices in your network(marked in blue as shown below). In the case below we have 5 active devices. The scan reveals that there are 5 active devices inside the given IP range. Now connect your camera to your router and re-run the scan. The scanner will display a new network device with the hostname ipcamera (only VGA cameras). If the Angry IP scanner does not resolve the hostname, it under Tools - Fetchers. If you are using more then one camera in your network we recommend, you only connect one camera at a time in order to differentiate them. If you are unsure which host is the camera, unplug the camera and re-scan the network. The now missing entry will reveal the cameras IP address. Once you discovered your camera´s IP address, simply copy the address by right-clicking on it and paste it into your web browsers address bar and press the Return button. Copy the IP address and paste it into your browsers address bar to load the cameras web user interface. You will now be greeted by the camera´s login page - the default credentials are username admin and the password can be left blank(or type in instar in case of a HD camera model). Congratulations!You now entered the cameras Web User Interface.","link": "/Quick_Installation/Alternative_IP_Scanner/Angry_IP_Scanner","title2": "Wie Sie Ihrer IP Kamera mit einem alternativen IP Scanner finden","chapter": "Quick Installation","tags": ["Introduction", "Quickinstallation", "Network"],"image":"http://placehold.it/594x380","abstract": "Use the Angry IP Scanner to Find your Camera","suggest" : {"input": [ "alternative", "scanner", "ip address", "angry" ],"output": "Alternative Network Scanner - Angry IP Scanner","payload" : { "articleId" : 1006 },"weight" : 8}}

IP Address: This is the IPv4 address of your camera isnide your local network. To access your camera´s web user interface, simply type in the IP address into the address bar of web browser. If your camera´s LAN port is not 80, please add the port to the IP address seperated by a : , like 192.168.1.125:8081. Subnetmask: The subnet mask defines the subnet your camera is connected to. It is 255.255.255.0 in most small networks. Gateway: The gateway is the connection between your local network and the internet. In most small networks it is the IP address of your router - e.g. 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1 or 192.168.178.1. DNS Server: The DNS server is needed by your camera to resolve internet addresses. In most small networks it is the IP address of your router - e.g. 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1 or 192.168.178.1. LAN Port: The LAN Port is the HTTP Port of your camera. Add this port to your camera´s IP address, if you want to access the web user interface with your web browser. This is also the port that you need to forward inside your router, to access your camera via it´s DDNS Address. We recommend that you use a HTTP port that is higher then 8080. RTMP (Flash) Port: The RTMP Port is the video streaming port for the Flash Video Plugin. Please forward this port if you want to access the web user interface over the internet. You do not need to forward the port to access your camera over our smartphone app! RTSP Authentification active: If you want to use a streaming software like VLC Player to access the RTSP Stream, you have the option to deactivate the need to authenticate. The stream will become freely available on your network. Please make sure that authentication is active before forwarding the RTSP port! RTSP Port: The RTSP Stream of your camera runs over the RTSP Port. Make sure that the port is forwarded inside your router, if you want to access it over your cameras DDNS Address.","link": "/Web_User_Interface/HD_Series/Network/IP_Configuration/","title2": "Das IP Konfiguration Overlay","chapter": "Web User Interface","tags": ["webUI", "interface", "UI", "LAN", "network", "configuration", "browser"],"image": "http://placehold.it/594x380","abstract": "Configure your Camera's Network Settings" ,"suggest" : {"input": [ "webUI", "UI", "configuration", "user interface", "interface", "browser" ],"output": "Web User Interface IP Configuration Overlay","payload" : { "articleId" : 1037 },"weight" : 1}}

Use the WiFi scanner to connect your camera to a different WiFi network. Or use the scan results to check the signal strenght at the camera´s installation spot. Connect to your WiFi Network. Password Guidelines: The WiFi password is limited to max. 63 characters and may not contain the following special characters. Search Manual: Please click on Search to let your camera search for wireless networks. Select your WiFi from the list below, add your WiFi key and Submit. After confirmation, simply unplug the Ethernet cable and your camera will connect to the WiFi network. Alternatively, type in the network parameter manually. Network Type: Choose if you want to connect your camera directly to another network device (ad hoc). Or if you want to add it to the local WiFi network of your wireless router (infra). Authentication Encryption: Choose the encryption standard that your router is using. We recommend that you set your router to use pure WPA2 (AES or CCMP) and not WPA+WPA2 (TKIP). Type of Encryption: Set the type of encryption to the same encryption that your router is using. We recommend to set your WiFi router to use the AES standard. In case of an AVM Fritzbox, select CCMP and couple it with AES inside your camera. WiFi Key: Here you need to add the WiFi key that you use to connect devices to your local wireless network. The WiFi can sometimes be found on a sticker directly on the router itself. If you cannot use the WPS service (Wireless Portected Setup) to integrate the camera into you local WiFi network - see included flyer Plug & Play for further information for the WPS function - click search to start the WLAN scanner. Just choose your own network and click “Join”. Now you just have to add the WiFi password (WLAN Key) and click submit to save the settings. Afterwards you can use the Test function to verify your settings. Please disconnect the LAN cable and restart the camera (simply unplug the power supply for 3 seconds). The camera will automatically - within max. 5 minutes - connect to your WiFi network. The cameras WiFi module will receive a new address from your router - in case you didn’t assign a static IP address to your camera yet. You might have to use the INSTAR Camera Tool again to rediscover your camera. Your camera is now connected via WiFi! Attention: Your WiFi modules MAC address is not identical with the LAN MAC address of your camera! In case you are using a MAC filtering rule for your WiFi network please deactivate the filter and add your camera to the list of trusted devices before reactivating it. Additional Remark: Your camera supports a range of encryption standards - we recommend for your safety and reliability of your connection, that you set your WiFi network to WPA2 (PSK) with AES (or CCMP). With older routers choose WPA (PSK) AES. Avoid using a mixed mode like WPA&WPA2 - TKIP! If your WiFi stays unstable please choose a fixed WiFi channel for your router - we recommend the channels 1 - 6.","link": "/Web_User_Interface/HD_Series/Network/WiFi/","title2": "Das WLAN Overlay","chapter": "Web User Interface","tags": ["webUI", "interface", "UI", "WLAN", "network", "configuration", "browser"],"image": "http://placehold.it/594x380","abstract": "Connect your Camera to the WiFi Network" ,"suggest" : {"input": [ "webUI", "UI", "configuration", "user interface", "interface", "browser" ],"output": "Web User Interface WiFi Overlay","payload" : { "articleId" : 1038 },"weight" : 1}}

Please be adviced that high quality settings come with high requirements for your computer hardware and network bandwidth. Adjust the video quality to obtain a fluent video accordingly. Please refer to RTSP Streaming for accessing the cameras streams 2 and 3. Adjust the Video Settings. Activate MJPEG Stream: Your camera is able to send the video, instead of an h.264 encoded stream, in form of a sequence of single snapshots. This Motion-JPEG Stream has the advantage, that it can be displayed in every web browser without the need for a video plugin. This is necessary if you want to see the live video on a computer where you don´t have the rights to install a browser plugin, e.g. your company PC. The disadvantage of this mode is that the compression is a lot weaker and you will need a lot more bandwidth. You can quickly activate deactivate the mode with the quick toggle in the Video Menu Bar.Video Channel: Your camera can send it´s h.264 video in form of three different streams, with different resolution. You can access all three of them independently with external software. Selecting a stream here defines which stream is displayed inside the web user interface. Video Resolution: Displays the resolution of the selected video stream. The video resolution is defined by the Video Channel that you choose above. E.g. the first channel is always streamed in 720p HD resolution. Video Framerate: This value represents the frames per seconds that you want your to stream. Please be aware that this is only a theoretical maximum that you don´t want your camera to exceed. The actual framerate might be bottlenecked by your camera´s network connection and the exposure time of the image sensor (the darker the image becomes, the longer the image sensor has to collect light and the longer it takes to create a frame). The framerate is suitable to set an upper limit to the bandwidth requirement of your camera, to prevent a network overload. The default value of 15 fps is usually a workable compromise for most surveillance tasks. Video Bitrate: The bitrate determines how many information can be packed into the video stream. Increasing the bitrate will massively increase the bandwidth requirements for accessing the stream over the local network and will also increase the file size of recorded videos. A significant advantage in image quality will only be achieved, if the video contains a lot of fine details. In most cases it is recommended to leave this value at it´s default of 1024-2048kbps. Video Encoding: You can adjust if you want to hold the set bitrate, or if you want your camera to automatically use a lower bitrate if the video is low in details (e.g. your camera can often work with a much lower bitrate during the night). This will effect the file size of recorded videos, the processor load of your camera, as well as the bandwidth requirements of the live stream. We recommend that you use the variable Bitrate. Image Quality: Set the JPG quality of each frame that will be used for the h.264 video. You will get the best results using a value of 3. Keyframe Interval: A key frame (I-Frame) is a frame encoded in its entirety, much like a JPEG image. P-frames are predicted, ie, they contain only the changes from frame to frame. Hence I frames are typically 10x larger than P frames, so the fewer you have, the more compression you can get. As a compromise between image quality and bandwidth requirement, it is recommended to create about 1 keyframe every second. With the default intervall of 20 frames and a framerate of 15fps, your camera will send an I-Frame every (20 Frames 15 Frames s) = 1.33s. h.264 Video Plugin: Here you can choose the video plugin the web user interface uses to diplay the h.264 videostream. The default plugin is Flash. The Quicktime Player or our ActiveX Player can be chooses alternatively. The ActiveX Plugin can only be used under Windows with the Internet Explorer or Firefox Browser, but offers few adavantages over the other plugins. In general we recommend the use of the Flash Plugin. MotionJPEG Video Mode: If you are using the MJPEG stream, you can choose between two modes - a real MJPEG Stream (recommended) and a simulated Stream that is created by letting your browser request a new snapshot for each frame. I am not sure what the latter is for - but it is always nice to have it :) The video settings allow you to adjust the quality of all 3 videostreams of your camera. Please be adviced that high quality settings come with high requirements for your computer hardware and network bandwidth. Adjust the video quality to obtain a fluent video accordingly.

Once the motion detection in an area is activated, its sensitivity can be adjusted from very insensitive (value=0) to very sensitive (value=100). Privacy Mask Menu: The Privacy Mask Menu allows you to black out areas from your surveillance. E.g. you can still see a part of the public street in front of your house on your surveillance videos. But you can not adjust the camera angle any more. Now you can setup up to 4 masks to prevent the street from showing up in your surveillance footage - just activate an area and draw it’s shape onto the image. Actions Menu: Adjust the cameras behaviour in case of a motion alert trigger event. You can set the camera to send you an email and to save snapshots or videos on your SD card. Please make sure you set your SMTP Server settings before activating the email notification and that you have a SD card in your cameras SDHC card slot (max. 32 GB) to use the video recording and send-to-FTP function - a 4 GB SD card is included in the delivery. Schedule Menu: Here you can define a time schedule in which the motion detection should be active for the active detection areas. Every blue square represents 30 minutes of armed motion detection. Please make sure to set the correct time zone as it will be used by the camera. Remember Daylight-Saving-Time! SMTP Server Menu: Simply use the INSTAR Preset if you don´t know the SMTP information of your Email provider. Choose the preset from the drop down menu and confirm. The Email recipient can be set in the Email Menu. Set-up this way, your camera will use an INSTAR Server to send alarm mails to your personal Email address. This transfer will be TLS encrypted and INSTAR does not store any copies of your Emails! Email Menu: Here you need to input the sender, the receivers, the subject as well as optional a short email text with a maximum 64 characters. The sender address should be in accordance with the SMTP server settings, though some email provider let you choose this field freely. If you want to send the email to more than one address, simply separate the addresses with a semicolon ;. E.g. max.mustermann@instar.de ; franz.fingerhut@instar.de. It is recommended to fill out the subject line and the email text body to avoid the mail to be caught by any spam guards in place. FTP Menu: To use the video FTP Upload you first have to set your ftp server address and login credentials. E.g. you can use your routers FTP service as FTP Server - in this case simply put in your routers IP as the FTP Server address. If you set up a FTP server on a local PC (for example with Filezilla Server), use the PC’s local IP address. Of course you can use webservers URL’s as well. The standard FTP port is 21. Audio Alarm Menu: The camera’s Audio Alarm uses the integrated microphone to detect noises and trigger alarm events. These events are handled just like motion detection events and will trigger the activated Alarm Actions. Please be aware that the sensitivity of the detection is both influenced by the sensitivity slider here, as well as by the overall volume of the microphone signal. You can adjust the amplification of the signal in the Multimedia Section. SD Card Menu: Please check the corresponding box and click submit to either format or unmount your SD card. It is recommended to always unmount your SD card before removing it from your camera! Your SD card might be unavailable after an unexpected restart.

Small areas are a lot more sensitive and should be used over parts of the image, where you never want to miss someone walking through. But they also lead to a large number of false alerts und should be used sparsely. You will receive a lot of false alarm notifications in the example above. Right: One big Area - small Areas only where they are critical. A big area is - according to the explanation above - much more resistent against false alerts. A big area over the whole image will only trigger an alert when a person comes very close to the camera. You can use a slightly higher sensitivity to compensate. To prevent that you might loose actual alarm events, add a smaller area where it is critical - e.g. a window or your front door. The smaller this area is is, the higher it´s sensitivity. To find the optimal setting, keep an eye on your camera´s System Log. If an area cause too many false alerts, make it bigger or decrease it´s sensitivity. Potential Errors: In case the camera’s position is prone to rapid light changes, e.g. changes in sun intensity due to cloud movements, you might be confronted with a high number of false alarms. In this case please refer to Actions Menu for employing a PIR motion detector.","link": "/Web_User_Interface/HD_Series/Alarm/Areas/","title2": "Das Alarm Bereiche Overlay","chapter": "Web User Interface","tags": ["webUI", "interface", "UI", "alarm", "areas", "configuration", "browser"],"image": "http://placehold.it/594x380","abstract": "Set the Detection Areas for Motion Detection" ,"suggest" : {"input": [ "webUI", "UI", "configuration", "user interface", "interface", "browser" ],"output": "Set the Detection Areas for Motion Detection","payload" : { "articleId" : 1058 },"weight" : 1}}

Please be aware that your camera will be in a constant state of alarm, if you set the alarm input to N.C. and you don´t connect an external sensor. Link alarm input and alarm areas: It is recommended to couple the internal motion detection with the external sensor. Please be aware, that you have to have at least one detection area active, when using the coupled state. Activate internal PIR sensor: Only IN-6014 HD - Activate the internal passive infrared sensor (PIR Motion Detector) to trigger an alert once a person enters the surveillance area. You can deactivate the alarm areas once the PIR sensor is active. Link PIR and motion detect areas: Only IN-6014 HD - You can also couple the alarm areas with the internal PIR sensor.

Software-based Motion Detection. The software-based motion detection used by your camera for the activated Alarm Areas does not need any additional hardware to work and can be very precise in controlled indoor environments. The disadvantage is that the detection does not discriminate causes for changes inside the cameras field of view - a cloud moving by in front of the sun, raindrops or vegetation moving in the wind. Everything can cause an alarm. Use an external Sensor. You can use a motion detector like the IN-Motion 500 to improve the detection rate of your camera (Only cameras with an Alarm-In contact) if your camera does not yet come with a PIR motion sensor equipped like the IN-6014 HD. Simply connect the sensor to the alarm input and activate the external input. The camera will trigger an alarm when the pins 3&4 are bridged and the relay state is set to closed on alarm (n.o. “Normally Open”). If it is set to open on alarm, the alarm will be triggered once the circuit is broken by the relay inside the detector (n.c. “Normally Closed”) or if the wire is disconnected. The state you have to choose depends on your sensor - the wrong choice will give a continuous alert once the detector is connected. Remark: When you are using an external sensor (or the internal PIR sensor in case of the IN-6014 HD), then you have to either deactivate the internal motion detection (Alarm Areas) or have to couple it with the Alarm Input! The alarm cannot be triggered otherwise. Once you coupled both detection methods, you always have to deactivate both to deactivate the motion detection! Use the internal Sensor (IN-6014 HD). Activating the internal or external PIR sensor allows you to limit the motion detection to bodies whose temperature differs from the background. In most cases, this will be a person or animal in front of the cameras or the warm motor of a car. Changes in light conditions, fog in front of the camera at night or movements in the wind will not be detected by the PIR sensor. By coupling the PIR sensor with the detection areas, you will only get an alarm event if both detection methods were triggered at the same time. This will greatly reduce the number of false alerts you might have. But be aware that it also might eliminate a few positive alerts. Switch external devices in case of an alarm (or manually). The external output connects to a relay inside the camera that can be switched manually or automatically in case of an alarm event. Please check Activate External Output to let the camera open or close a circuit with an external device connected to the pins 1&2. The external output can be used with the cameras motion detection to activate signalling devices like sirens or LED lights. It can also be used to control connected devices manually, e.g. via our smartphone app. The relay can be connected to circuits with up to 60 V direct current 125 V alternating current and max. 1 A.","link": "/Web_User_Interface/HD_Series/Alarm/Actions/","title2": "Das Alarm Aktionen Overlay","chapter": "Web User Interface","tags": ["webUI", "interface", "UI", "alarm", "actions", "configuration", "browser"],"image": "http://placehold.it/594x380","abstract": "Configure what you want to happen in case of an Alert" ,"suggest" : {"input": [ "webUI", "UI", "configuration", "user interface", "interface", "browser" ],"output": "Configure what you want to happen in case of an Alert","payload" : { "articleId" : 1060 },"weight" : 1}}

One connection is the internal access which with we access the WebUI of the camera. This means that the computer as well as the camera are running in the same network and are most likely connected to the same router. You can then connect to the camera using the private IP address of the camera. The other connection is the external access to open the WebUI of the camera from outside your network. With this connection you can allow the access from anywhere in the world to your camera. No matter if you are sitting in the train using a smartphone or if you are on holidays using a laptop to access. To make this possible a few settings are necessary in the camera as well as in your router. This tutorial shows you step by step how to set up the external connection. Three easy steps to set up the access to your INSTAR IP camera from outside your network via internet. Static IP address: Connect to the camera with the private IP address. Once you opened the web interface please click on Network IP Configuration. The default setting is that the IP gets assigned by DHCP Server which means the router is giving the camera a free IP address every 24 -48 hours. This would have the effect that we have to change all settings again after this time period. In order to make sure the IP address is not changing we have to assign the camera a fixed IP address which doesn't change. Please uncheck the box Obtain IP from DHCP Server and some new fields will appear for our settings. You should see something like this - IP Address: The first three numbers define the IP area of the router and therefore are the same as the routers IP address. Only the last number has to be changed to a unique address. It is important that no other device. Subnet Mask: The default subnet mask for most private networks is 255.255.255.0. You can open the command prompt or MacOSX terminal and type ipconfig all to check your subnet mask (as well as the default gateway and DNS server - see below). Gateway: Here you have to fill in the IP address of your router. Usually the same as your camera´s IP address but with a 1 (number one) in the final octet - like 192.168.1.1 . DNS Server: Normally this is always the same as the Gateway. In our sample we used an open DNS server from Google 8.8.8.8. HTTP Port: This is the internal Port (also called LAN Port) of the camera - the default port is 80. If you run into difficulties connecting with your camera over the internet, change this port to a number higher than 8080 (8081, 8082, etc.). Please remember that you also have to adjust this port inside your routers port forwarding. This data has to be filled in for each camera. Very important is that the IP address is never given twice to a device since otherwise it would cause a IP conflict. It is the easiest if you are using continues IP addresses. For example camera one gets 192.168.178.190 and then camera two should be set to 192.168.178.191 and so on. Also the Port number should be given continues. Excursus: Please notice that the first 3 numbers of the IP address define the IP area of the router. In our sample we have used the AVM Fritz!Box. Another example would be the Telekom Speedport from T-Mobile. This router uses by default the IP area 192.168.2.x. Most other common routers such as TP-Link or others are using the IP area 192.168.1.x. The x can mean a number between 1 and 256. All routers normaly are using the number 1. In our sample above we used 190 as the IP address for the camera. This is normaly better since a high number is mostly not used by the routers DHCP Server. If the address is too low (for example 100) then the change that this number is given twice to a device (once by you and once by the DHCP Server) is very high. If you are experiencing troubles accessing the IP address of your camera you might change the IP and try if it is better. After you have set the IP address of the camera you can then access it in any webbrowser and the web interface of the camera should open. Important is that this device where you try to open the web interface from is inside your network. If you dont know the IP address of your router you might check it in the MS-Dos Command windows by typing in ipconfig. This will show you the computers and the routers IP address just in case you are not sure which IP is the right one. Checking the DDNS address: This step is very easy. Please open the web interface of your camera and click on Network - DDNS Service. Here you will find the Manufacturer Domain. This is the address with which you can access your camera over the internet. Remember this address! It normally consist of 4 letters and 2 numbers plus the server domain (e.g. ddns-instar.com). For example if it used the servers xxxxx.ddns-instar.com or xxxxx.ddns-instar.de then the x stands for the 6 letters numbers. Please make sure that the third party DDNS is set to None. Now please click on System - Info. The DDNS Status has to be displayed as successful. If in some case this DDNS address is missing in your camera please contact the INSTAR Support. If the status is unsuccessful, your camera might have a problem connecting to the internet. You can try restarting the camera and check its IP configuration - especially the DNS Server and Gateway. Please contact the INSTAR support team if the problem persists. You can also check your DDNS address manually with a small program called nslookup. Open your command prompt (in Windows: go to Start and type in cmd) and type nslookup to start the program. Now type in your DDNS address and wait for the response (see screenshots below). The IP address that is displayed has to be identical with the camera´s WAN IP address. You can check your WAN IP inside your router. Or open the website wieistmeineip.de and compare the displayed IPv4 address with the nslookup result. Open your command prompt and type nslookup to start the program. Type in your personal DDNS address and press Enter. The displayed IPv4 address has to be identical with your WAN IP address for the DDNS connection to work. Port Forwarding Portforwarding Firewall NAT- or Port-Rules Virtual Server. In the third and last step we have to tell the router to which IP and which Port he has to connect if you access from the internet in order to access your camera. Therefor your have to set a rule in your router. In most routers this is called port forwarding but some other routers might name it NAT, Firewall or Port rules. Each router also used different expressions for the settings. Our goal is it to make you understand the settings so that you can easily fill out your own routers information for the port forwarding. In our sample we use the AVM Fritz!Box again to show you how to set it. To open the router just use the IP address which we filled in as gateway above and open it in the web browser. You should now see the login screen for your router. In the Fritz!Box you find this settings by clicking Internet - Portfreigabe. Normally all routers need the same following data. Application: There are a lot of presets which you can choose from. Such as HTTP Server, Webserver or others. We recommend to make a custom rule each time instead of using a preset rule. Name: This is only important if you are using more then one camera so that you can differentiate later between the different cameras. You can name it for example with the camera name or the camera location. Protocol: The camera only needs the TCP protocol. You don't need to forward UDP traffic. From (external) Port: This is the external (WAN) Port with which you can access the camera later through the internet. If you are only using one camera it is best to set it as 80. If you are using more then one camera you have to increase the port for each camera. So the second camera would use the Port 8081 for example. To (external) Port: Some routers might use Port 80 as the Service Port. If so you have to use Port 8081 for the first camera. IP Address: Here you have to fill in the IP address from the camera. To (internal) Port: This is the internal Port of the camera which we have set up earlier. If you are using a different Port then 80 inside your network then you have to set it here accordingly. We recommend to use Port 80 at this moment. If you want to set up more then one camera you have to make sure that for each camera you will create a port rule in your router. The external Port has to be unique for every camera. We recommend to increase the Port number by one. So first camera is using Port 80 and the second one should use Port 81 and the third camera Port 82 and so on. After you created the Port rule for each camera you should type in the DDNS address + the Port number. For example: xxxxx.ddns-instar.com:80 Excursus: To access your camera you can always use the same DDNS address. So if you have more then one camera you only need to remember one address. Most important is that you change the port behind the DDNS number. The reason behind it is that your internet service provider is assigning you a new IP address every 24 hours. Once the address is changed the camera notices this and sents it to the server in order to connect it to our DDNS address. This way you can always access your camera with one address even so the IP behind it changes. So even if you are using different DDNS addresses they all link to one address. So with every address you will access your router. And because of the port forwarding your router then knows to which device you want to be forwarded to. So for example we type the following to access the cameras: Camera 1: d2908.ddns-instar.com:80 Camera 2: d2908.ddns-instar.com:8081 Camera 3: d2908.ddns-instar.com:8082 and so on. Note: If you are using a Fritz!Box or a Netgear Router you can test the connection from within your own network. Most other routers do not support this function. So it is necessary to test it from outside your network. For example from a friends computer or from your computer at work. If you try this with Port 80 and you access your router instead of the camera then you might try to use Port 8081 since it could be that 80 is the service port of your router. If you are using a smartphone App you normally have to fill in the DDNS number instead of the normal IP address and also the Port through which you access the camera. You can also check the user manuals for our Windows Phone, iOS and Android App.","link": "/Internet_Access/The_DDNS_Service","title2": "Der DDNS Dienst","chapter": "Internet Access","tags": ["internet", "access", "ddns", "port", "forwarding", "router", "internet access"],"image": "http://placehold.it/594x380","abstract": "Access your Camera over it's Internet Address" ,"suggest" : {"input": [ "ddns", "internet access", "port", "forwarding", "router"],"output": "Access your Camera over it's Internet Address","payload" : { "articleId" : 1074 },"weight" : 10}}

Every website sits behind a number - it´s IP address - and the DNS servers of the internet allow you to connect to them without memorizing them. Whenever you type google.com into your browsers address bar, your computer or smartphone calls out and checks the domain name directories of the internet for the corresponding IP address. An IP address is a unique number that allows computers to locate each other on a network. The Internet is a big network and uses IP addresses to route communication to the proper host. The IP in IP address stands for Internet Protocol. What is this DDNS all about? Why do we hide the real addresses of our websites behind domain names? Firstly, the IP addresses are a bit difficult to memorize for organic brains like ours. And secondly, the IP address of a web site might change over time. The latter is a smaller problem for Google - they pay for the IP addresses and they will keep them for a while - but it is a big problem if you want to use an IP camera at home (or in general a local webserver for that matter). Your router is assigned a WAN IP address (Wide Area Network) by your internet services provider. This is your telephone number that allows you to call home when your are at work. You can check your personal WAN IP by opening a web site like wieistmeineip.de. You can check the IP address of your websites yourself, by typing nslookup into your command prompt and then the web domain you want to check. In this case we found that one of the IP address of google.com is 173.194.127.160. So if checking your WAN IP address is so simple, why not write it down and just use it to connect to your camera? The problem is, that your WAN IP address usually changes every 24hrs. You can usually buy static IP addresses from your provider - but if you don´t want to spend extra money on that, you would have to check your WAN IP address every morning before leaving your house. Having a static domain name that is automatically updated with the newest WAN IP address of your router every time the address changes starts to sound tempting? Why would I want to have a Third Party DDNS Address? That is why we already installed a DDNS address on your INSTAR camera. You can always use this service to connect to your camera from the internet (IF you have a port forwarding set up inside your router!). So why would you want to have a third party DDNS address running to connect to your camera? Every INSTAR camera comes with a preinstalled DDNS address so you don´t have to worry about the things we talk about here. In the INSTAR DDNS address seen above instar01 is your cameras personal host, the ddns3-instar.de is the domain of our DDNS server and the complete address instar01.ddns3-instar.de is called the hostname of your address. For security reasons, the host part installed on your camera is generated randomly and cannot be traced back to your purchase. And the domain name is given by the server your camera is registered to. This means you don´t have any control over your camera´s hostname. We already try to make them as easy to remember as possible - but maybe you just want to have a personalize address? Or being able to access your camera at any time is very important and you are looking for redundancy? That is where third party supplier will come in handy. So just hop to a website like www.noip.com, create a account and install it on your camera? Well yes, that is possible. But the interesting part is that you don´t have to deactivate your INSTAR DDNS address in your camera to use a third party one. You can set it up inside your router, on a webserver that is running all the time anyway or on the surveillance station ( QNAP or Synology) you use with your camera. This way you can have a personalized, and easy to remember, hostname - but still have your INSTAR address as a fall back option. And yes, you heard right! You just need one DDNS address, that is either maintained by your camera or your router, to connect to any device inside your local network. As we discussed earlier, the DDNS hostname is fancy way of writing down your routers WAN IP address. So, even if you have 5 INSTAR cameras running in your network, every single one of those DDNS addresses will just lead you to your router. The router then decides, based on the port the request is coming from, which cameras should be called. So basically, you only have to memorize 1 DDNS address and vary the port to call different cameras: Camera 1: instar01.ddns3-instar.de:8081, Camera 2: instar01.ddns3-instar.de:8082, Camera 3: instar01.ddns3-instar.de:8083. For information on how to forward these ports and why you should choose ports above 8080, please read on in our port forwarding article that will walk you through the setup for a couple of standard internet routers. In the following we will set up 3 different third party DDNS addresses on different systems. You will see that setting up the hostname and using it with an update service on your router or any other system is very easy and the steps are always the same - no matter what provider and hardware you plan to use. We choose those three providers because they offer free hostnames for you to experiment with.

Opening specific ports can allow web servers (like your camera), BitTorrent clients, games, and other applications to work through the usual security of your router that otherwise does not permit connections to these ports. Connect to your Camera over the Internet: Software ports are numbered connections that a computer uses to sort types of network traffic. A few services, such as FTP on port 21 and HTTP on port 80, are assigned by default to open ports where operating systems can find them easily. When a port is opened, a service, such as a the web user interface of your IP camera, is assigned to it. For security, by default all ports to the Internet and most LAN ports are closed so that traffic cannot flow through them. Which is why you cannot connect to your camera via the internet (DDNS) address. Connect to your Routers Interface Enter your router’s IP address into the address bar of a web browser. This will open your router’s configuration page. For most routers, this will be 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1 or 192.168.178.1. If you don´t know the exact IP address of your router you can use your command prompt or terminal to determine it. The router’s IP address is usually the same as the Default Gateway - at least in home and small business networks. For Windows: Open the command prompt and enter ipconfig all. For Mac: Open the terminal and enter netstat -nr. For Linux: Open the terminal and enter route. The Default Gateway of your home or small business network is most likely the IP address of your router. Access your Router: If you've already configured the security settings for your router, enter the username and password you chose then. If not, check the sticker on your router for a device password (this is not the same as the WiFi password!). In case you cannot find a password, try typing in default password + your routers model number into the search engine of your liking - for example GOOGLE. The default password for your router should be among the first few page hits. There are also websites devoted to this problem - you can check portforward.com or routerpasswords.com for your router model. If you've forgotten your login information, you can press the reset button on your router to reset it to factory defaults. You can then look up the factory default settings online. Type in your router login to access the configuration interface. Access your Router: Find the Port Forwarding section - Each router will be slightly different. Common labels are Port Forwarding, Applications, Gaming, Virtual Servers, Freigaben, Spiele und Anwendungen, Portweiterleitung, NAT Firewall. If you don't see one of these or something similar, try Advanced Settings and look for a Port Forwarding subsection. Once you found the section, enter a name for the service - e.g. INSTAR camera. Then choose the service type - This can be TCP, UDP, or both. Your IP camera only needs the TCP protocol. Then select the ports you wish to use. For your camera you have to open it´s web http internal port that you can set in the camera webUI under Network IP Configuration. If you want to access the RTSP stream of an HD camera model you will have to forward the corresponding RTSP port. Now select the IP address of your camera and assign the port forwarding to it. This is the IP address that is displayed by the INSTAR camera tool and that you can see in your browsers address bar when you accessed the camera´s web user interface. How this looks like strongly depends on the router and firmware version you are using. In the following we will discuss the necessary steps for the most common routers in home networks. If your router is not among this selection please read on on portforward.com that has a much larger collection of router example available. Portforwarding: The steps of forwarding a port to your camera are mostly the same in every router. In the following we present a few examples from common router manufacturer.

General Recommendation INSTAR VGA camera live streams can only be accessed via the HTTP port (default 80) that is also used by the web user interface (webUI). In case of an INSTAR HD camera you can also use the RTSP stream that is transported via a different port (default 554). It is recommended not to open the default ports to the internet - as this can make your local network vulnerable against attacks. There is also a problem that default ports might be used by different services and not be available. Some internet provider even block all ports from 1 - 1024, forcing you to use a much higher port for your camera. Fortunately, there are plenty of ports to choose from - 65536 ( 216 ) to be specific. We recommend you try using a port that is bigger than 8080 - the last port that is regularly used by web based services. Please keep in mind that changing the default HTTP port of your camera forces you to add this new port to the IP address of your camera separated by a : if you want to access the web user interface with your browser locally - e.g. 192.168.178.199:8081. It might, therefore, be more convenient to forward the RTSP port instead and access the camera through our smartphone app as RTSP camera. This way you will not be able to access the cameras webUI - but this can be an advantage from a security point of view. Fritzbox 7490 Set your Camera Ports First, take a look at your cameras HTTP and - in case of a HD model - RTSP port. As mentioned above, they can be changed to non-default port. Remember the port you have chosen and open your router in a new tab - the default IP address is 192.168.178.1, alternatively, you can type fritz.box to navigate to the user interface. The default login is username = admin and the password is provided on a sticker at the back of your FritzBox. You HD cameras live stream is accessible via two ports that can be forwarded. For VGA cameras you only have to worry about the HTTP port. Open the router web user interface via the default IP address 192.168.178.1 or by typing fritz.box into the address bar of your browser. Setup a Portforwarding Rule Go to Internet Freigaben and click on Neue Portfreigabe. Choose Andere Anwendung from the drop down menu. To forward a port open Internet Freigaben and click on Neue Portfreigabe. Now fill out the following dialogue: Portfreigabe aktiv für: Choose Andere Anwendung. Bezeichnung: Here you can choose a name for the port forwarding. If you have more then one port forwarding we recommend you to use a unique name. Protokoll: Please select TCP. von Port: Choose the port you set inside your camera - HTTP or RTSP. Remember that every camera needs a unique port - you cannot use the same port for different cameras. Remember to add the Port at the end of your cameras internet address if you want to access it from another place. For example if your camera uses Port 8081 you have to type (xxx.ddns-instar.com:8081). bis Port: Here you can fill in the same Port as in von Port or you can leave it blank. an IP Adresse: Please fill in the IP address which your camera is using. This is the same address which you are using to access your camera through the web browser in your local network. It should start with 192.168.178.x. If you cannot find the camera´s IP in the drop-down menu, choose Manuelle Eingabe and type it in manually. Fill out the remaining fields according to the information above. Repeat those steps for the second port if you choose to forward both the HTTP and RTSP port for your camera. In the example above, the HD camera can now be reached from the internet via the HTTP port 8081 - just type in your camera´s DDNS address (XXXXXX.ddns-instar.com) - you can find it in the camera´s webUI under Network DDNS - into our smartphone app and add the web port 8081 in the field underneath. If you choose to add the camera via it´s RTSP stream - choose the camera model with the added (RTSP) from the drop down menu - type in the RTSP port 51001 instead. Fritzbox 7390 To access the user interface of your router open the following address with your internet browser 192.168.178.1 . The default login is username = admin and the password is provided on a sticker at the back of your FritzBox. Navigate to the menu Internet and then Freigaben as shown below to fill in the following data: Portfreigabe aktiv für: Either you choose Portfreigabe aktiv für or Andere Anwendung. Bezeichnung: Here you can choose a name for the port forwarding. If you have more then one port forwarding we recommend you to use a unique name. Protokoll: Please select TCP. von Port: lease choose 80 as the Port. If you are already using this Port for another camera or Server you can also choose another Port. If you are using more then one Port you have to remember to add the Port at the end of your cameras Internet address if you want to access it from another place. For example if your camera uses Port 81 you have to type (xxx.ddns-instar.com:81). bis Port: Here you can fill in the same Port as in von Port or you can leave it blank. an IP Adresse: Please fill in the IP address which your camera is using. This is the same address which you are using to access your camera through the web browser in your local network. It should start with 192.168.178.x. an Port: Please fill in Port 80. Troubleshooting: As mentioned above, choosing the right port for your camera is vital. The default ports work most of the time - but if they don´t, it can be very difficult to figure out who the culprit is. It is best to choose a port outside of the regular range of web ports if you run into problems. Especially, mobile internet providers often block ports up to 1024 or even to 8080. Mobile access points - 3G LTE routers that are operated via SIM cards - often do not provide a public IP address that is needed for the DDNS service. If you are using mobile internet and you cannot connect to your camera from external network, check if your contract offers a static WAN IP address. This is often provided with Business Packages but not available for lower priced contracts. A public address for your router is mandatory for the DDNS access to work! Another problem are so called DS-Lite (Dual Stack Lite) connections - it is, in general impossible, to access your camera via DDNS if your provider assigns you a DSLite connection. You can check if this is the case by checking if you have an IPv6 address next to your normal IPv4 address. The solution for both the missing public IP and DSLite tunnels is a new technology that was added to the HD camera line. All INSTAR HD cameras come with a Point-2-Point UserID (P2P UID) that allows you to connect our mobile app to the camera without the need of a port forwarding. This technology will work behind mobile access points without a public IP as well as behind DSLite IPv6 connections. Another Problem might be the parental control settings inside your router. Please check if your camera is allowed to connect to the internet in the Kindersicherung (Parental Control) section: Click on Kindersicherung on the main page, or go to Internet Filter and check if there are any restrictions active for your camera. If yes, click on the pencil button to lift the restriction (choose Unbeschränkt). Adding More Cameras: If you are using more then one camera you have to also create another Port rule for each camera.Please make sure that the Öffentliche Port is always different for each port forwarding. For example if you are using Port 8081 for the first camera then the second camera should have the Port 8082 and the third camera Port 8083 and so on. To access each camera you would type in something like this: Camera 1: ab1234.ddns-instar.com:8081, Camera 2: ab1234.ddns-instar.com:8082 and so on... Note: You can access all cameras with only one internet address. Only the Port at the end has to be changed. Therefore, you do not have to remember all DDNS addresses of the camera. You only need to remember one address. Port Forwarding :: AVM Fritzbox To access your camera through the internet you will need a portforwarding service inside your router.

So that camera takes the last picture and compares it with the new one. This will also have the effect that the camera will notice a change of brightness in the picture in the same way as it notices a person or object moving through the picture. With the sensitivity you can set how many percentage of a picture has to change until the camera will cause an alarm. HD Camera Series: To activate the motion detection, open the web interface of your INSTAR HD IP camera and click on the menu Alarm Areas. You can select which area of the video the motion detection should be armed in the Areas Overlay. Therefore please select the Area on the right side for which you want to do the settings. Next please click Active. You will see that the area which you have set to Active is now showing a colour. Also on top the number for the area activated will light up in red to symbolize that this area is active. By simply clicking into the picture and dragging your mouse you can choose the area for motion detection. The motion detection will be armed in the area you have selected. In case you want to select the whole area you can click Full Area on the right side in order to activate the motion detection over the whole picture. Now you can use the slide bar to set the sensitivity for the motion. 1 = Insensitive (almost no motion gets detected) 100 = Very Sensitive (almost every motion will be recorded). We recommend you so leave the motion sensitivity at 50 and slowly test which setting will deliver the best result. Repeat the above steps in case you want to set more then one area. Each area will be given a different colour: Area 1 = red, Area 2 = blue, Area 3 = green, Area 4 = yellow. Submit the settings in order to save all settings in the camera. You will need to select an Action so that the camera knows what it should do in case of an alarm. Please open the menu Alarm Actions. Here you can now set if the camera should sent you an email with snapshots in the attachment or if the pictures should be saved to an SD card or an FTP server. In order to save pictures or videos to an SD card please make sure an SD card in inserted in your camera. Finally please Submit the settings. Attention: If you have problems by receiving to many alarms you can solve that by doing different settings. Always set the sensitivity so the motion you want to detect can be detected by the camera. Usually this will be humans that need to be detected. Just simply use a setting so that the motion that is caused by a human will be detected soon enough to cause an alarm. So if the settings are currently 5 and you notice that sometimes that motion gets not detected simply change it to 6 as we recommend so that should solve the problem. To avoid unwanted motion detection please try to make sure that areas like the sky with moving clouds, streets in the background or big reflecting areas and others are not part of the are the camera is protecting. To find the right camera position you can change the viewing angle a little bit or mount the camera on a different area which suits better to protects you home. This can reduce the quantity of false alarms enormously. VGA Camera Series: To activate the motion detection, open the web interface of your INSTAR VGA IP camera and click on the menu Alarm Alarm. 1 = nonsensitive (almost no motion gets detected) 10 = very sensitive (almost every motion will be recorded). We recommend you so set the motion sensitivity to 6. The cameras integrated motion detection only works over the whole picture. With our additional software InstarVision for Windows computers you can define different areas in the picture for which you want to use motion detection. That means not the whole picture will be included in the motion detection but only the areas you have selected. For other operating system we currently have to use third party developers such as the software Motion, EvoCam, ZoneMinder, VitaminD and many others. The use of third party software is no problem with our cameras since they are integrated in most software versions. If you find that our cameras are not integrated you can contact us anytime so we can arrange the integration. Please note that the software of third party developers are only working with the livestream of the camera. So in order to use the functions offered by the third party software you need to have your computer running and the software opened. Attention: If you have problems by receiving to many alarms you can solve that by doing different settings. Always set the sensitivity so the motion you want to detect can be detected by the camera. Usually this will be humans that need to be detected. Just simply use a setting so that the motion that is caused by a human will be detected soon enough to cause an alarm.

To find the right camera position you can change the viewing angle a little bit or mount the camera on a different area which suits better to protects you home. This can reduce the quantity of false alarms enormously. As soon as you camera is detection a motion you have 3 options in order to get a notification or to record the motion: 1. Email: The IP camera will automatically sent you an email with 6 pictures in the attachment. The computer does not need to run for this function since the camera has a direct connection to the router. 2. FTP Upload: The IP camera will sent pictures to your FTP Server. With this function there will be pictures saved for a time period of 1 minute in case of an alarm. The computer does not need to run for this function. Alternative: The FTP Upload gives you the additional function to upload pictures in a fixed time interval. With this function you can for example have one picture saved every 10 seconds for an unlimited time. The picture can either be saved with the same name or the name can be created by the camera automatically by using date and time as the picture name. 3. Video: A 1 minute video can be automatically recorded. This function is only working if you are using the Internet Explorer as a webbrowser since a ActiveX Plugin is necessary to record the video to your computer. So in order to save the video the computer needs to be running and the IP address of the camera has to be opened in Internet Explorer showing the livestream. If you use our addtional software InstarVision you can also record videos. Also you can record them with a high compression and in different video formats in order to save space on your harddrive. Alternative: You can also make a continues recording with the Internet Explorer. Therefor just activate the recording manually by pressing the record button on the upper left side.","link": "/Motion_Detection/Setup/", "title2": "Aktivieren Sie die Bewegungserkennung Ihrer Kamera", "chapter": "Motion Detection","tags": ["motion detection", "alarm", "notification", "email", "detection areas", "FTP"],"image": "http://placehold.it/594x380","abstract": "Set up the Motion Detection Function" ,"suggest" : {"input": [ "motion detection", "email notification", "ftp upload", "areas", "schedule" ],"output": "Set up the Motion Detection Function", "payload" : { "articleId" : 1086 },"weight" : 1}}

Step 1: In order that the camera can sent you pictures by email you have to save your email providers data inside the camera. This can be done if you open the web interface of your IP camera and then click on Alarm in order to open the SMTP Server. On the upcoming overlay you now have to fill in the following data: SMTP Server: Here you have to fill in the SMTP Server from your email provider. Mostly you can find this data on the website of your email provider by searching for SMTP. Otherwise you find a list HERE. SMTP Port: Fill in the Port which your email provider is using. Normally this will be either Port 25, 465 or 587. SSL: Here you can activate if your account is using SSL encryption. SMTP Login Type: For almost all email servers this has to be set to Authentication so that you can identify yourself with your username and password. SMTP Username: Please fill in the username of your email account. SMTP Password: Please fill in the password of your email account. Please enter your email accounts SMTP data and your personal login and save all settings by clicking Submit. Step 2: Next please open the Alarm Email Overlay to set the receiver and the sender of the alarm emails. Please fill in all necessary data: Sender: Please fill in your email address. This can be the same email address as the receiver. Receiver: Please fill in the email address that should receive the alarm message. Email Subject: The subject will be shown in every email you receive. Email Text: Will be shown together with the alarm pictures in each email. To save all settings please press Submit. You will now be able to test the settings. Step 3: To receive emails in case of an alarm you will need to activate the motion detection in your camera and select what the camera should do in case of an alarm. All necessary settings are explained HERE. If you need help with any kind of settings please feel free to contact us any time. VGA Camera Series - Setting up and activating the email alarm. Step 1: In order that the camera can sent you pictures by email you have to save your email providers data inside the camera. This can be done if you open the web interface of your IP camera and then click on Alarm in order to open the Email Menu. On the right side you now have to fill in the following data: Sender: Please fill in your email address. This can be the same email address as the receiver. Receiver 1: Please fill in the email address that should receive the alarm message. SMTP Server: Here you have to fill in the SMTP Server from your email provider. Mostly you can find this data on the website of your email provider by searching for SMTP. Otherwise you find a list HERE. SMTP Port: Fill in the Port which your email provider is using. Normally this will be either Port 25, 465 or 587. Transport Layer Security Protocol: You only need this if you are using Gmail as your email provider. Please choose either TLS or STARTTLS depending on which one you are using. Need Authentication: For almost all email servers this has to be activated so that you can identify yourself with your username and password. SMTP User: Please fill in the username of your email account. SMTP Password: Please fill in the password of your email account. Report Internet IP by Mail: This function can normally be deactivated. If you activate this service the camera will sent you always the newest internet IP address. Every 24 hours your ISP changes your IP address so the camera will always sent you the newest one. Since the camera has a integrated DDNS address this function is normally not needed. Now please save all settings by clicking Submit. After submitting the data to the camera we recommend you to click Test in order to see if the data you typed in was right. Step 2: After you have now saved all email settings in your camera you still have to activate the email alarm in order to receive an alarm email when a motion is detected. Therefor please click Alarm and choose Alarm in the sub menu. In the next window please set Motion Detect Armed and activate Send E-Mail on Alarm as show in the screenshot below. After that please choose Submit to save the settings. If your camera detects a motion you will now be informed with a email and 6 pictures in the attachment. Notes: Please note that the camera can not detect weather it is a human motion or a motion caused by heavy rain or fast light changes. Depending how many false alarms you will receive you might change the sensibility a little. (1= insensitive and 10= very sensitive). Troubleshooting - Gmail Problem: You set up a new GMail account just for your camera´s alarm notifications. But the Test-Email always fails because of a faulty authentication. Solution: Google monitors your behaviour to estimate if it is really you, who accesses the email account. When you use a new device - e.g. another smartphone or your IP camera - to login to your account, Google might block you and ask for a two stage authentication. This will cause your Test-Email to fail. Please log into your account via your web browser and and check if your GMail account was blocked or Google tells you they caught a suspicious activity. Just authenticate yourself and or the device that caused the activity. Problem: GMail always worked fine, but now you stopped receiving alarm emails. But you are still receiving emails from other senders in your GMail account. Solution: GMail started to limit the amount of emails that you are allowed to send with a free account. Your camera is using the GMail SMTP server to send alarm emails and is therefore using up the amount of mails you are allowed to send. You can set up a separate GMail account for your camera to avoid this interference with your personal emails. Problem: You cannot send a Test Email - the login fails. Solution: Activate the SMTP access for less secure apps. Open on your Email Account menu, choose Account to open your Account Settings and go to the Sign In Settings and allow the access from less secure apps. Telekom Speedport: Problem: You are using your camera behind a Telekom Speedport and typed in your SMTP server and login credentials but the Test-Email always fails. Solution: The Telekom Speedport introduced a list of allowed SMTP servers into it´s Firmware, which is activated by default. Even though this list contains most common SMTP servers - it might still interfere with your attempts to contact SMTP servers with your camera. You can deactivate the Email Abuse Detection for a moment (maybe restart your Speedport afterwards) and try again. Deactivate the Mail Abuse Detection and re-try sending your Test-Email. If it works, add your SMTP server address to the list of allowed addresses and activate the function again. T-Online Mail: Problem: You set up a new T-Online mail account just for your camera´s alarm notifications. But the Test-Email always fails because of a faulty authentication. Solution: You need to set a separate email password for external apps to connect to your T-Online mail account. Log in to your T-Online web account and open then Menu Properties. Go to Passwords and click on Change your Email Password. Follow the instructions and confirm your password. Log into your camera´s WebUI, open the Alarm SMTP Server Overlay and choose the T-Online preset. Type in your complete mail address as username and add the password you created in the step above. Add your T-Online address in the Alarm Email Overlay and submit and test the connection.","link": "/Motion_Detection/Alarm_Notification/", "title2": "Lassen Sie sich von Ihrer Kamera alarmieren", "chapter": "Motion Detection","tags": ["motion detection", "alarm", "notification", "email", "detection areas", "FTP"],"image": "http://placehold.it/594x380","abstract": "Set up the Alarm Notification" ,"suggest" : {"input": [ "motion detection", "email notification", "ftp upload", "areas", "schedule" ],"output": "Set up the Alarm Notification", "payload" : { "articleId" : 1087 },"weight" : 1}}

To quickly access your recordings, click on the SD Card link inside your cameras web user interface. Or use a third-party Software to download the video. SD Card Access: The HD camera models use an internal (removable) SD card to record videos, alarm snapshots and whole photo series that can be used for later time lapse conversions. You can access the recorded files directly via the cameras web user interface or with an FTP client. The webUI is the quickest way to download files and screen them on your computer, tablet or smartphone from your default web browser. But FTP clients offer a few features that will be more convenient if you have to go through a large number of files from your SD card. Please be aware that the FTP client has to support the hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP) to access the SD card. Please be aware that you will only be able to download files - the FTP clients will not offer your WRITE rights on the SD storage! Below you can find a short selection of clients that will work with your INSTAR camera. For indoor models you can always remove the SD card and use it with a card reader on your computer or mobile device for easy access. Web User Interface. The HD camera models allow you to record videos and snapshots to the internal SD card. To quickly access your recordings, click on the SD Card link inside your cameras web user interface. Click on the SD Card link above your cameras live video. Web User Interface. The SD cards file directory will open in a new tab. Please type in your camera login to access your recorded files. If the link is not displayed the SD is no longer mounted by the cameras operating system - please remove the SD card and push it back into the SD card slot. You are able to screen and download your recordings after confirming your camera login. SD Card Index. Your camera generates a new directory for each new day and a new recordXXX directory for every 200 recordings of that day. Every alarm event creates an *.avi file that starts with the capital letter A - planned recordings with the letter P and so on - followed by a timecode for the alarm trigger. File System. The default behavior of most internet browsers is to download the video after you clicked on it. Browsers like the Mozilla Firefox off you support for the VLC plugin to display the video directly inside the browser window. Please make sure that you activate the Firefox plugin during the installation process of the VLC player and restart your browser after the installation.

    How to connect your camera directly with your computer via an Ethernet cable
    The following instructions will explain to you step by step how you can create a direct LAN connection between your computer and an INSTAR IP camera. Use this approach if you want to use the camera in an area, that does not provide a network infrastructure or to if you want to configure the camera to connect to a Wifi network when you don´t have a LAN Ethernet connection available to make the initial Wifi configuration. Connect the camera with a regular Ethernet cable to your PC or Notebook (Very old PCs might still need a special - Crossover - cable to make this connections). Search the Camera:  Install/Open the INSTAR Camera Tool which will show you the following message after clicking the Search button: (you might have to select the correct network interface to which the camera is connected to. If for example you have a VPN connection, an active bluetooth module and the regular LAN interface, then you have to select the LAN interface in order to find your IP camera. Open the camera tool and press Search. Assign a static IP to your Windows PC Open the Network- and Sharing Centre (Control Panel -> Network and Security). The interface will show you a new unidentified LAN connection. Open it´s settings by clicking Local Area Network. Go to Properties, select the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and select Properties as shown below. Open the Windows Network- and Sharing Centre and go to the LAN adapter properties. The following window will open and allow you to set a static IP address for your PC/Laptop. Submit the settings by clicking OK and return to the IP Camera Tool. Open the IPv4 properties. Please fill in a valid IP address for your computer and set it to be new networks gateway and DNS server (see below): Assign a static IP address to your PC. Assign a static IP to your Mac Open the menu System Preferences go to Network and click on Ethernet. Please choose Configure IPv4: Manually and type in a valid IP address. Use the same IP address as the Router IP. Submit the new settings with Apply and return to the IP Camera Tool. Go to the Sytem Preferences and open the Ethernet configuration. Assign a static IP to your Camera Click on ''IP Config'' and select your camera on the left side. Fill in the IP address for the camera. The address has to be in the same IP subnet you used for your computer in '''step 3''' but has to be different from the address you choose above - e.g. '''just add 1''' to the last octet (see example below)! The Gateway and DNS server will be the IP address of your computer that you set above. If you are using a class C network the standard subnet mask is (Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0). Open the IP configuration tab of the INSTAR camera tool and set a valid IP address and submit. After submitting the data the camera will restart which takes about 30 seconds. Click on Search to find the camera again and double-click die camera entry to open the WebUI inside your default browser. If you want to use a different browser, type in the camera´s IP address into your browser´s address line and press Return. You are now able to change the camera´s settings and access the live stream. Open the camera´s new IP address with your default browser. If you choose the direct connection to do the initial WLAN configuration of your camera to integrate it into an existing Wifi network, type in the WLAN information under Network/WIFi and change the cameras IP address to a free address in the IP subnet that is used inside the wireless network. The camera will then restart - please unplug the LAN cable right after submitting the new IP address to allow the camera to connect to your wireless LAN.",

    Alternative IP Scanner
    How to find your IP Camera in the network with an alternative IP Scanner The IP Camera Tool (Windows), IP Camera Tool (MacOSX) or IP Camera Tool (Linux) is for sure the most comfortable way to find your IP camera inside your network. Instructions on how to set up your INSTAR IP camera with the Camera Tool can be found here. If, for some reason, the IP Camera Tool does not work on your computer, here are a few other options to discover the IP address. The camera will try to receive an IP address automatically (DHCP) during the first installation. Most routers will give you a log file of fresh DHCP requests, in which you should be able to find the camera´s IP address. You should reach the cameras login portal by typing this address into the web browser´s address bar. If you do not have access to your router or if your router does not have any log files please refer to alternative IP scanners - an examples is:
    Angry IP Scanner (Windows/MacOSX/Linux)
    You can find the newest Version here for Windows/MacOSX/Linux - install and start the application, type in the IP range and start the search. Please fill out the field IP Range with the IP range that your router´s DHCP service is set to. If you do not know the IP range, then simply use the command line on Windows, type in ipconfig and check your computers IPv4 address (see screenshot below). Use this IP address in Angry IP Scanner and just change the last octet to 1 for the start IP address and 254 for the last IP address to search the complete /24 subnet. Make sure your camera is disconnected from your network and then press Start to begin the scan.
    You can use the ipconfig command to confirm the IP range of your network. The scanner will now display all active devices in your network (marked in blue as shown below). In the case below we have 5 active devices. The scan reveals that there are 5 active devices inside the given IP range. Now connect your camera to your router and re-run the scan. The scanner will display a new network device with the hostname ipcamera (only VGA cameras). If the Angry IP scanner does not resolve the hostname, it under Tools - Fetchers. If you are using more then one camera in your network we recommend, you only connect one camera at a time in order to differentiate them.
    If you are unsure which host is the camera, unplug the camera and re-scan the network. The now missing entry will reveal the cameras IP address. Once you discovered your camera´s IP address, simply copy the address by right-clicking on it and paste it into your web browsers address bar and press the Return button.
    Copy the IP address and paste it into your browsers address bar to load the cameras web user interface. You will now be greeted by the camera´s login page - the default credentials are username admin and the password can be left blank (or type in instar in case of a HD camera model). Congratulations! You now entered the cameras Web User Interface.",

It is cross-platform and lightweight. Not requiring any installations, it can be freely copied and used anywhere. Angry IP scanner simply pings each IP address to check if it’s alive, then optionally it is resolving its hostname, determines the MAC address, scans ports, etc. Alternative IP Scanner How to find your IP Camera in the network with an alternative IP Scanner The IP Camera Tool(Windows), IP Camera Tool(MacOSX) or IP Camera Tool(Linux) is for sure the most comfortable way to find your IP camera inside your network. Instructions on how to set up your INSTAR IP camera with the Camera Tool can be found here. If, for some reason, the IP Camera Tool does not work on your computer, here are a few other options to discover the IP address. The camera will try to receive an IP address automatically(DHCP) during the first installation. Most routers will give you a log file of fresh DHCP requests, in which you should be able to find the camera´s IP address. You should reach the cameras login portal by typing this address into the web browser´s address bar. If you do not have access to your router or if your router does not have any log files please refer to alternative IP scanners - an examples is:Angry IP Scanner(Windows/MacOSX/Linux) You can find the newest Version here for Windows/MacOSX/Linux - install and start the application, type in the IP range and start the search. Please fill out the field IP Range with the IP range that your router´s DHCP service is set to. If you do not know the IP range, then simply use the command line on Windows, type in ipconfig and check your computers IPv4 address(see screenshot below). Use this IP address in Angry IP Scanner and just change the last octet to 1 for the start IP address and 254 for the last IP address to search the complete /24 subnet. Make sure your camera is disconnected from your network and then press Start to begin the scan. You can use the ipconfig command to confirm the IP range of your network. The scanner will now display all active devices in your network(marked in blue as shown below). In the case below we have 5 active devices. The scan reveals that there are 5 active devices inside the given IP range. Now connect your camera to your router and re-run the scan. The scanner will display a new network device with the hostname ipcamera (only VGA cameras). If the Angry IP scanner does not resolve the hostname, it under Tools - Fetchers. If you are using more then one camera in your network we recommend, you only connect one camera at a time in order to differentiate them. If you are unsure which host is the camera, unplug the camera and re-scan the network. The now missing entry will reveal the cameras IP address. Once you discovered your camera´s IP address, simply copy the address by right-clicking on it and paste it into your web browsers address bar and press the Return button. Copy the IP address and paste it into your browsers address bar to load the cameras web user interface. You will now be greeted by the camera´s login page - the default credentials are username admin and the password can be left blank(or type in instar in case of a HD camera model).
