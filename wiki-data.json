Use this approach if you want to use the camera in an area, that does not provide a network infrastructure or to if you want to configure the camera to connect to a Wifi network when you don´t have a LAN Ethernet connection available to make the initial Wifi configuration. Connect the Camera Connect the camera with a regular Ethernet cable to your PC or Notebook(Very old PCs might still need a special - Crossover - cable to make this connections). Search the Camera Install/Open the INSTAR Camera Tool which will show you the following message after clicking the ''Search'' button:(you might have to select the correct network interface to which the camera is connected to. If for example you have a VPN connection, an active bluetooth module and the regular LAN interface, then you have to select the LAN interface in order to find your IP camera. Open the camera tool and press Search. Assign a static IP to your Windows PC Open the Network- and Sharing Centre(Control Panel ->Network and Security). The interface will show you a new unidentified LAN connection. Open it´s settings by clicking Local Area Network. Go to Properties, select the Internet Protocol Version 4(TCP/IPv4) and select Properties as shown below. Open the Windows Network- and Sharing Centre and go to the LAN adapter properties. The following window will open and allow you to set a static IP address for your PC/Laptop. Submit the settings by clicking OK and return to the IP Camera Tool. Open the IPv4 properties. Please fill in a valid IP address for your computer and set it to be new networks gateway and DNS server(see below):Assign a static IP address to your PC. Assign a static IP to your Mac Open the menu System Preferences go to Network and click on Ethernet. Please choose Configure IPv4:Manually and type in a valid IP address. Use the same IP address as the Router IP. Submit the new settings with Apply and return to the IP Camera Tool. Go to the Sytem Preferences and open the Ethernet configuration. Assign a static IP to your Camera Click on ''IP Config'' and select your camera on the left side. Fill in the IP address for the camera. The address has to be in the same IP subnet you used for your computer in '''step 3''' but has to be different from the address you choose above - e.g. '''just add 1''' to the last octet(see example below)!The Gateway and DNS server will be the IP address of your computer that you set above. If you are using a class C network the standard subnet mask is(Subnet Mask:255.255.255.0). Open the IP configuration tab of the INSTAR camera tool and set a valid IP address and submit. After submitting the data the camera will restart which takes about 30 seconds. Click on Search to find the camera again and double-click die camera entry to open the WebUI inside your default browser. If you want to use a different browser, type in the camera´s IP address into your browser´s address line and press Return. You are now able to change the camera´s settings and access the live stream. Open the camera´s new IP address with your default browser. If you choose the direct connection to do the initial WLAN configuration of your camera to integrate it into an existing Wifi network, type in the WLAN information under Network/WIFi and change the cameras IP address to a free address in the IP subnet that is used inside the wireless network. The camera will then restart - please unplug the LAN cable right after submitting the new IP address to allow the camera to connect to your wireless LAN.","link":"/Quick_Installation/Direct_LAN_Connection","title2": "Direkte Verbindung mit einem PC oder Notebook","chapter": "Quick Installation","tags":["Introduction", "Quickinstallation", "Network"],"image": "/images/Search/InstarWiki_SearchThumb_DirectConnectionWithYourPC.jpg","abstract": "Direct Connection between your Computer and your Camera","suggest" : {"input": [ "direct", "connection", "ethernet", "lan cable" ],"output": "Direct LAN Cable Connection","payload" : { "articleId" : 1004 },"weight" : 10}}

It is cross-platform and lightweight. Not requiring any installations, it can be freely copied and used anywhere. Angry IP scanner simply pings each IP address to check if it’s alive, then optionally it is resolving its hostname, determines the MAC address, scans ports, etc. Alternative IP Scanner How to find your IP Camera in the network with an alternative IP Scanner The IP Camera Tool(Windows), IP Camera Tool(MacOSX) or IP Camera Tool(Linux) is for sure the most comfortable way to find your IP camera inside your network. Instructions on how to set up your INSTAR IP camera with the Camera Tool can be found here. If, for some reason, the IP Camera Tool does not work on your computer, here are a few other options to discover the IP address. The camera will try to receive an IP address automatically(DHCP) during the first installation. Most routers will give you a log file of fresh DHCP requests, in which you should be able to find the camera´s IP address. You should reach the cameras login portal by typing this address into the web browser´s address bar. If you do not have access to your router or if your router does not have any log files please refer to alternative IP scanners - an examples is:Angry IP Scanner(Windows/MacOSX/Linux) You can find the newest Version here for Windows/MacOSX/Linux - install and start the application, type in the IP range and start the search. Please fill out the field IP Range with the IP range that your router´s DHCP service is set to. If you do not know the IP range, then simply use the command line on Windows, type in ipconfig and check your computers IPv4 address(see screenshot below). Use this IP address in Angry IP Scanner and just change the last octet to 1 for the start IP address and 254 for the last IP address to search the complete /24 subnet. Make sure your camera is disconnected from your network and then press Start to begin the scan. You can use the ipconfig command to confirm the IP range of your network. The scanner will now display all active devices in your network(marked in blue as shown below). In the case below we have 5 active devices. The scan reveals that there are 5 active devices inside the given IP range. Now connect your camera to your router and re-run the scan. The scanner will display a new network device with the hostname ipcamera (only VGA cameras). If the Angry IP scanner does not resolve the hostname, it under Tools - Fetchers. If you are using more then one camera in your network we recommend, you only connect one camera at a time in order to differentiate them. If you are unsure which host is the camera, unplug the camera and re-scan the network. The now missing entry will reveal the cameras IP address. Once you discovered your camera´s IP address, simply copy the address by right-clicking on it and paste it into your web browsers address bar and press the Return button. Copy the IP address and paste it into your browsers address bar to load the cameras web user interface. You will now be greeted by the camera´s login page - the default credentials are username admin and the password can be left blank(or type in instar in case of a HD camera model).

Change your cameras IP address, gateway and DNS server - all these settings are usually set up by the installation wizard and don´t need to be changed. The camera´s http port might have to be changed to access your cameras webUI over the internet. The RTSP port is the camera´s RTSP streaming port. Set the Network Configuration: You can set whether the camera will be assigned an IP address by your router (DHCP) or, if you want to manually set a fixed address. Please check here on how to set a fixed IP address. In general, we recommend that you deactivate the automatic service and set a manual IP to avoid further trouble with the remote access to your camera. For the RTSP Port please refer to RTSP Streaming for details on the use of the camera´s RTSP videostream. Remember to forward the RTSP Port if you want to access the RTSP Stream over the internet with your DDNS Address. The RTMP Port is used by the Flash plugin in your camera´s web user interface.Remember to forward the RTMP Port (alongside your LAN Port!) if you want to access the web user interface over the internet with your DDNS Address. IP Address: This is the IPv4 address of your camera isnide your local network. To access your camera´s web user interface, simply type in the IP address into the address bar of web browser. If your camera´s LAN port is not 80, please add the port to the IP address seperated by a : , like 192.168.1.125:8081. Subnetmask: The subnet mask defines the subnet your camera is connected to. It is 255.255.255.0 in most small networks. Gateway: The gateway is the connection between your local network and the internet. In most small networks it is the IP address of your router - e.g. 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1 or 192.168.178.1. DNS Server: The DNS server is needed by your camera to resolve internet addresses. In most small networks it is the IP address of your router - e.g. 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1 or 192.168.178.1. LAN Port: The LAN Port is the HTTP Port of your camera. Add this port to your camera´s IP address, if you want to access the web user interface with your web browser. This is also the port that you need to forward inside your router, to access your camera via it´s DDNS Address. We recommend that you use a HTTP port that is higher then 8080. RTMP (Flash) Port: The RTMP Port is the video streaming port for the Flash Video Plugin. Please forward this port if you want to access the web user interface over the internet. You do not need to forward the port to access your camera over our smartphone app! RTSP Authentification active: If you want to use a streaming software like VLC Player to access the RTSP Stream, you have the option to deactivate the need to authenticate. The stream will become freely available on your network. Please make sure that authentication is active before forwarding the RTSP port! RTSP Port: The RTSP Stream of your camera runs over the RTSP Port.

Search Manual: Please click on Search to let your camera search for wireless networks. Select your WiFi from the list below, add your WiFi key and Submit. After confirmation, simply unplug the Ethernet cable and your camera will connect to the WiFi network. Alternatively, type in the network parameter manually. Network Type: Choose if you want to connect your camera directly to another network device (ad hoc). Or if you want to add it to the local WiFi network of your wireless router (infra). Authentication Encryption: Choose the encryption standard that your router is using. We recommend that you set your router to use pure WPA2 (AES or CCMP) and not WPA+WPA2 (TKIP). Type of Encryption: Set the type of encryption to the same encryption that your router is using. We recommend to set your WiFi router to use the AES standard. In case of an AVM Fritzbox, select CCMP and couple it with AES inside your camera. WiFi Key: Here you need to add the WiFi key that you use to connect devices to your local wireless network. The WiFi can sometimes be found on a sticker directly on the router itself. If you cannot use the WPS service (Wireless Portected Setup) to integrate the camera into you local WiFi network - see included flyer Plug & Play for further information for the WPS function - click search to start the WLAN scanner. Just choose your own network and click “Join”. Now you just have to add the WiFi password (WLAN Key) and click submit to save the settings. Afterwards you can use the Test function to verify your settings. Please disconnect the LAN cable and restart the camera (simply unplug the power supply for 3 seconds). The camera will automatically - within max. 5 minutes - connect to your WiFi network. The cameras WiFi module will receive a new address from your router - in case you didn’t assign a static IP address to your camera yet. You might have to use the INSTAR Camera Tool again to rediscover your camera. Your camera is now connected via WiFi! Attention: Your WiFi modules MAC address is not identical with the LAN MAC address of your camera! In case you are using a MAC filtering rule for your WiFi network please deactivate the filter and add your camera to the list of trusted devices before reactivating it. Additional Remark: Your camera supports a range of encryption standards - we recommend for your safety and reliability of your connection, that you set your WiFi network to WPA2 (PSK) with AES (or CCMP). With older routers choose WPA (PSK) AES. Avoid using a mixed mode like WPA&WPA2 - TKIP!

That means you cannot use an external IR spotlight with your camera, if the internal IR lights are turned off. Deactivate the Nightvision LEDs. Infrared LED Status: Here you can adjust the behaviour of the infrared LEDs of the camera. You can choose between 2 modes in which the LEDs are either always off or automatically switched on by a photodiode when it is getting dark. Time Schedule for IR LEDs: In case that you are not satisfied with the automatic mode - e.g. the night mode always switches on to early or switches off too late - you can set fixed times for those events here. Please be aware that it is not possible to permanently activate the IR LEDs. If you deactivate the IR LEDs by night you might get false alerts from the internal motion detection. In this case, you will have to deactivate the motion detection during the night using the alarm schedule.","link": "/Web_User_Interface/HD_Series/System/IR_LED/","title2": "Das IR LED Overlay","chapter": "Web User Interface","tags": ["webUI", "interface", "UI", "system", "IR", "Infrared", "LED", "network", "configuration", "browser"],"image": "/images/Search/","abstract": "Adjust the Behaviour of the Infrared LEDs" ,"suggest" : {"input": [ "webUI", "UI", "configuration", "user interface", "interface", "browser" ],"output": "Adjust the Behaviour of the Infrared LEDs","payload" : { "articleId" : 1047 },"weight" : 1}}

Please be adviced that high quality settings come with high requirements for your computer hardware and network bandwidth. Adjust the video quality to obtain a fluent video accordingly. Please refer to RTSP Streaming for accessing the cameras streams 2 and 3. Adjust the Video Settings. Activate MJPEG Stream: Your camera is able to send the video, instead of an h.264 encoded stream, in form of a sequence of single snapshots. This Motion-JPEG Stream has the advantage, that it can be displayed in every web browser without the need for a video plugin. This is necessary if you want to see the live video on a computer where you don´t have the rights to install a browser plugin, e.g. your company PC. The disadvantage of this mode is that the compression is a lot weaker and you will need a lot more bandwidth. You can quickly activate deactivate the mode with the quick toggle in the Video Menu Bar.Video Channel: Your camera can send it´s h.264 video in form of three different streams, with different resolution. You can access all three of them independently with external software. Selecting a stream here defines which stream is displayed inside the web user interface. Video Resolution: Displays the resolution of the selected video stream. The video resolution is defined by the Video Channel that you choose above. E.g. the first channel is always streamed in 720p HD resolution. Video Framerate: This value represents the frames per seconds that you want your to stream. Please be aware that this is only a theoretical maximum that you don´t want your camera to exceed. The actual framerate might be bottlenecked by your camera´s network connection and the exposure time of the image sensor (the darker the image becomes, the longer the image sensor has to collect light and the longer it takes to create a frame). The framerate is suitable to set an upper limit to the bandwidth requirement of your camera, to prevent a network overload. The default value of 15 fps is usually a workable compromise for most surveillance tasks. Video Bitrate: The bitrate determines how many information can be packed into the video stream. Increasing the bitrate will massively increase the bandwidth requirements for accessing the stream over the local network and will also increase the file size of recorded videos. A significant advantage in image quality will only be achieved, if the video contains a lot of fine details. In most cases it is recommended to leave this value at it´s default of 1024-2048kbps. Video Encoding: You can adjust if you want to hold the set bitrate, or if you want your camera to automatically use a lower bitrate if the video is low in details (e.g. your camera can often work with a much lower bitrate during the night). This will effect the file size of recorded videos, the processor load of your camera, as well as the bandwidth requirements of the live stream. We recommend that you use the variable Bitrate. Image Quality: Set the JPG quality of each frame that will be used for the h.264 video. You will get the best results using a value of 3. Keyframe Interval: A key frame (I-Frame) is a frame encoded in its entirety, much like a JPEG image. P-frames are predicted, ie, they contain only the changes from frame to frame. Hence I frames are typically 10x larger than P frames, so the fewer you have, the more compression you can get. As a compromise between image quality and bandwidth requirement, it is recommended to create about 1 keyframe every second. With the default intervall of 20 frames and a framerate of 15fps, your camera will send an I-Frame every (20 Frames 15 Frames s) = 1.33s. h.264 Video Plugin: Here you can choose the video plugin the web user interface uses to diplay the h.264 videostream. The default plugin is Flash. The Quicktime Player or our ActiveX Player can be chooses alternatively. The ActiveX Plugin can only be used under Windows with the Internet Explorer or Firefox Browser, but offers few adavantages over the other plugins. In general we recommend the use of the Flash Plugin. MotionJPEG Video Mode: If you are using the MJPEG stream, you can choose between two modes - a real MJPEG Stream (recommended) and a simulated Stream that is created by letting your browser request a new snapshot for each frame. I am not sure what the latter is for - but it is always nice to have it :) The video settings allow you to adjust the quality of all 3 videostreams of your camera. Please be adviced that high quality settings come with high requirements for your computer hardware and network bandwidth. Adjust the video quality to obtain a fluent video accordingly.

You can setup up to 4 detection areas - just activate an area and draw it’s shape onto the image - and adjusts it´s sensitivity to set a threshold for trigger events. Once the motion detection in an area is activated, its sensitivity can be adjusted from very insensitive (value=0) to very sensitive (value=100). Privacy Mask Menu: The Privacy Mask Menu allows you to black out areas from your surveillance. E.g. you can still see a part of the public street in front of your house on your surveillance videos. But you can not adjust the camera angle any more. Now you can setup up to 4 masks to prevent the street from showing up in your surveillance footage - just activate an area and draw it’s shape onto the image. Actions Menu: Adjust the cameras behaviour in case of a motion alert trigger event. You can set the camera to send you an email and to save snapshots or videos on your SD card. Please make sure you set your SMTP Server settings before activating the email notification and that you have a SD card in your cameras SDHC card slot (max. 32 GB) to use the video recording and send-to-FTP function - a 4 GB SD card is included in the delivery. Schedule Menu: Here you can define a time schedule in which the motion detection should be active for the active detection areas. Every blue square represents 30 minutes of armed motion detection. Please make sure to set the correct time zone as it will be used by the camera. Remember Daylight-Saving-Time! SMTP Server Menu: Simply use the INSTAR Preset if you don´t know the SMTP information of your Email provider. Choose the preset from the drop down menu and confirm. The Email recipient can be set in the Email Menu. Set-up this way, your camera will use an INSTAR Server to send alarm mails to your personal Email address. This transfer will be TLS encrypted and INSTAR does not store any copies of your Emails! Email Menu: Here you need to input the sender, the receivers, the subject as well as optional a short email text with a maximum 64 characters. The sender address should be in accordance with the SMTP server settings, though some email provider let you choose this field freely. If you want to send the email to more than one address, simply separate the addresses with a semicolon ;. E.g. max.mustermann@instar.de ; franz.fingerhut@instar.de. It is recommended to fill out the subject line and the email text body to avoid the mail to be caught by any spam guards in place. FTP Menu: To use the video FTP Upload you first have to set your ftp server address and login credentials. E.g. you can use your routers FTP service as FTP Server - in this case simply put in your routers IP as the FTP Server address. If you set up a FTP server on a local PC (for example with Filezilla Server), use the PC’s local IP address. Of course you can use webservers URL’s as well. The standard FTP port is 21. Audio Alarm Menu: The camera’s Audio Alarm uses the integrated microphone to detect noises and trigger alarm events. These events are handled just like motion detection events and will trigger the activated Alarm Actions. Please be aware that the sensitivity of the detection is both influenced by the sensitivity slider here, as well as by the overall volume of the microphone signal. You can adjust the amplification of the signal in the Multimedia Section. SD Card Menu: Please check the corresponding box and click submit to either format or unmount your SD card.

Once the motion detection in an area is activated, its sensitivity can be adjusted from very insensitive (value=0) to very sensitive (value=100). Set Motion Detection Areas. Areas: Klicken Sie auf den Radio Button hinter dem Bereich (1-4) den Sie bearbeiten möchten. Bewegen Sie danach Ihren Mauszeiger über das Bild Ihrer Kamera, halten Sie die linke Maustaste gedrückt und ziehen Sie ein Rechteck über dem Bild auf. Um einen zweiten Bereich aufzuziehen, wählen Sie den entsprechenden Bereich aus und wiederholen die weiteren Schritte. Die Bewegungserkennung der Kamera wird danach nur innerhalb dieser Bereiche nach Bewegungen suchen. Active: Der Haken hinter Aktiv aktiviert den entsprechenden Bereich. D.h. die Kamera beginnt innerhalb dieses Bereiches nach Bewegungen zu suchen und wird bei einer positiven Erkennung, die von Ihnen gewählten Alarmaktionen auslösen. In der Menüleiste über dem Livevideo finden Sie einen Shortcut um die einzelnen Bereich schnell zu aktivieren deaktivieren, ohne das Bereiche Menü aufrufen zu müssen. Sobald eine der Zahlen 1-4 rot dargestellt wird, ist der zugehörige Bereich aktiv. Sensitivity: Legen Sie hier fest, wie viele Pixel sich im Bild ändern müssen um eine Alarmaktion auszulösen. Umso höher die Empfindlichkeit ist, desto weniger muss sich im Bildinhalt verändern um einen Alarm auszulösen. Beachten Sie bitte, dass die Empfindlichkeit auch von der Größe des Bereiches abhängt. Ein Objekt, dass 100 Pixel im Videobild ein nimmt, nimmt prozentual eine größere Fläche in einem kleinen Bereich ein, als in einem großen Bereich. Wenn Sie zu viele Fehlalarme erhalten, versuchen Sie die Bereiche größer einzuzeichnen. Wenn Ihnen die Erkennung zu unempfindlich ist, zeichnen Sie kleinere Bereiche im Bild ein. All: Klicken Sie auf diesen Button um den ausgewählten Bereich über dem ganzen Bild aufzuspannen. Reset: Bewegen Sie den ausgewählten Bereich wieder in seine Ausgangsposition. Define Areas that will be used for the Motion Detection. The alarm areas detect motion by a picture analysis that is sensitive to every change inside the video frame instead of employing an infrared or microwave sensor. You can setup up to 4 detection areas - just activate an area and draw it’s shape onto the image - and adjusts it´s sensitivity to set a threshold for trigger events. Once the motion detection in an area is activated, its sensitivity can be adjusted from very insensitive (value=0) to very sensitive (value=100). Wrong: Many small Alarm Areas distributed over the Frame. The smaller an area, the bigger (in percent) a change in the image will be. Small areas are a lot more sensitive and should be used over parts of the image, where you never want to miss someone walking through. But they also lead to a large number of false alerts und should be used sparsely. You will receive a lot of false alarm notifications in the example above. Right: One big Area - small Areas only where they are critical. A big area is - according to the explanation above - much more resistent against false alerts. A big area over the whole image will only trigger an alert when a person comes very close to the camera. You can use a slightly higher sensitivity to compensate. To prevent that you might loose actual alarm events, add a smaller area where it is critical - e.g. a window or your front door. The smaller this area is is, the higher it´s sensitivity. To find the optimal setting, keep an eye on your camera´s System Log. If an area cause too many false alerts, make it bigger or decrease it´s sensitivity. Potential Errors: In case the camera’s position is prone to rapid light changes, e.g. changes in sun intensity due to cloud movements, you might be confronted with a high number of false alarms. In this case please refer to Actions Menu for employing a PIR motion detector.","link": "/Web_User_Interface/HD_Series/Alarm/Areas/","title2": "Das Alarm Bereiche Overlay","chapter": "Web User Interface","tags": ["webUI", "interface", "UI", "alarm", "areas", "configuration", "browser"],"image": "/images/Search/","abstract": "Set the Detection Areas for Motion Detection" ,"suggest" : {"input": [ "webUI", "UI", "configuration", "user interface", "interface", "browser" ],"output": "Set the Detection Areas for Motion Detection","payload" : { "articleId" : 1058 },"weight" : 1}}

Software-based Motion Detection. The software-based motion detection used by your camera for the activated Alarm Areas does not need any additional hardware to work and can be very precise in controlled indoor environments. The disadvantage is that the detection does not discriminate causes for changes inside the cameras field of view - a cloud moving by in front of the sun, raindrops or vegetation moving in the wind. Everything can cause an alarm. Use an external Sensor. You can use a motion detector like the IN-Motion 500 to improve the detection rate of your camera (Only cameras with an Alarm-In contact) if your camera does not yet come with a PIR motion sensor equipped like the IN-6014 HD. Simply connect the sensor to the alarm input and activate the external input. The camera will trigger an alarm when the pins 3&4 are bridged and the relay state is set to closed on alarm (n.o. “Normally Open”). If it is set to open on alarm, the alarm will be triggered once the circuit is broken by the relay inside the detector (n.c. “Normally Closed”) or if the wire is disconnected. The state you have to choose depends on your sensor - the wrong choice will give a continuous alert once the detector is connected. Remark: When you are using an external sensor (or the internal PIR sensor in case of the IN-6014 HD), then you have to either deactivate the internal motion detection (Alarm Areas) or have to couple it with the Alarm Input! The alarm cannot be triggered otherwise. Once you coupled both detection methods, you always have to deactivate both to deactivate the motion detection! Use the internal Sensor (IN-6014 HD). Activating the internal or external PIR sensor allows you to limit the motion detection to bodies whose temperature differs from the background. In most cases, this will be a person or animal in front of the cameras or the warm motor of a car. Changes in light conditions, fog in front of the camera at night or movements in the wind will not be detected by the PIR sensor. By coupling the PIR sensor with the detection areas, you will only get an alarm event if both detection methods were triggered at the same time. This will greatly reduce the number of false alerts you might have. But be aware that it also might eliminate a few positive alerts. Switch external devices in case of an alarm (or manually). The external output connects to a relay inside the camera that can be switched manually or automatically in case of an alarm event. Please check Activate External Output to let the camera open or close a circuit with an external device connected to the pins 1&2. The external output can be used with the cameras motion detection to activate signalling devices like sirens or LED lights. It can also be used to control connected devices manually, e.g. via our smartphone app. The relay can be connected to circuits with up to 60 V direct current 125 V alternating current and max. 1 A.","link": "/Web_User_Interface/HD_Series/Alarm/Actions/","title2": "Das Alarm Aktionen Overlay","chapter": "Web User Interface","tags": ["webUI", "interface", "UI", "alarm", "actions", "configuration", "browser"],"image": "/images/Search/","abstract": "Configure what you want to happen in case of an Alert" ,"suggest" : {"input": [ "webUI", "UI", "configuration", "user interface", "interface", "browser" ],"output": "Configure what you want to happen in case of an Alert","payload" : { "articleId" : 1060 },"weight" : 1}}

One connection is the internal access which with we access the WebUI of the camera. This means that the computer as well as the camera are running in the same network and are most likely connected to the same router. You can then connect to the camera using the private IP address of the camera. The other connection is the external access to open the WebUI of the camera from outside your network. With this connection you can allow the access from anywhere in the world to your camera. No matter if you are sitting in the train using a smartphone or if you are on holidays using a laptop to access. To make this possible a few settings are necessary in the camera as well as in your router. This tutorial shows you step by step how to set up the external connection. Three easy steps to set up the access to your INSTAR IP camera from outside your network via internet. Static IP address: Connect to the camera with the private IP address. Once you opened the web interface please click on Network IP Configuration. The default setting is that the IP gets assigned by DHCP Server which means the router is giving the camera a free IP address every 24 -48 hours. This would have the effect that we have to change all settings again after this time period. In order to make sure the IP address is not changing we have to assign the camera a fixed IP address which doesn't change. Please uncheck the box Obtain IP from DHCP Server and some new fields will appear for our settings. You should see something like this - IP Address: The first three numbers define the IP area of the router and therefore are the same as the routers IP address. Only the last number has to be changed to a unique address. It is important that no other device. Subnet Mask: The default subnet mask for most private networks is 255.255.255.0. You can open the command prompt or MacOSX terminal and type ipconfig all to check your subnet mask (as well as the default gateway and DNS server - see below). Gateway: Here you have to fill in the IP address of your router. Usually the same as your camera´s IP address but with a 1 (number one) in the final octet - like 192.168.1.1 . DNS Server: Normally this is always the same as the Gateway. In our sample we used an open DNS server from Google 8.8.8.8. HTTP Port: This is the internal Port (also called LAN Port) of the camera - the default port is 80. If you run into difficulties connecting with your camera over the internet, change this port to a number higher than 8080 (8081, 8082, etc.). Please remember that you also have to adjust this port inside your routers port forwarding. This data has to be filled in for each camera. Very important is that the IP address is never given twice to a device since otherwise it would cause a IP conflict. It is the easiest if you are using continues IP addresses. For example camera one gets 192.168.178.190 and then camera two should be set to 192.168.178.191 and so on. Also the Port number should be given continues. Excursus: Please notice that the first 3 numbers of the IP address define the IP area of the router. In our sample we have used the AVM Fritz!Box. Another example would be the Telekom Speedport from T-Mobile. This router uses by default the IP area 192.168.2.x. Most other common routers such as TP-Link or others are using the IP area 192.168.1.x. The x can mean a number between 1 and 256. All routers normaly are using the number 1. In our sample above we used 190 as the IP address for the camera. This is normaly better since a high number is mostly not used by the routers DHCP Server. If the address is too low (for example 100) then the change that this number is given twice to a device (once by you and once by the DHCP Server) is very high. If you are experiencing troubles accessing the IP address of your camera you might change the IP and try if it is better. After you have set the IP address of the camera you can then access it in any webbrowser and the web interface of the camera should open. Important is that this device where you try to open the web interface from is inside your network. If you dont know the IP address of your router you might check it in the MS-Dos Command windows by typing in ipconfig. This will show you the computers and the routers IP address just in case you are not sure which IP is the right one. Checking the DDNS address: This step is very easy. Please open the web interface of your camera and click on Network - DDNS Service. Here you will find the Manufacturer Domain. This is the address with which you can access your camera over the internet. Remember this address! It normally consist of 4 letters and 2 numbers plus the server domain (e.g. ddns-instar.com). For example if it used the servers xxxxx.ddns-instar.com or xxxxx.ddns-instar.de then the x stands for the 6 letters numbers. Please make sure that the third party DDNS is set to None. Now please click on System - Info. The DDNS Status has to be displayed as successful. If in some case this DDNS address is missing in your camera please contact the INSTAR Support. If the status is unsuccessful, your camera might have a problem connecting to the internet. You can try restarting the camera and check its IP configuration - especially the DNS Server and Gateway. Please contact the INSTAR support team if the problem persists. You can also check your DDNS address manually with a small program called nslookup. Open your command prompt (in Windows: go to Start and type in cmd) and type nslookup to start the program. Now type in your DDNS address and wait for the response (see screenshots below). The IP address that is displayed has to be identical with the camera´s WAN IP address. You can check your WAN IP inside your router. Or open the website wieistmeineip.de and compare the displayed IPv4 address with the nslookup result. Open your command prompt and type nslookup to start the program. Type in your personal DDNS address and press Enter. The displayed IPv4 address has to be identical with your WAN IP address for the DDNS connection to work. Port Forwarding Portforwarding Firewall NAT- or Port-Rules Virtual Server. In the third and last step we have to tell the router to which IP and which Port he has to connect if you access from the internet in order to access your camera. Therefor your have to set a rule in your router. In most routers this is called port forwarding but some other routers might name it NAT, Firewall or Port rules. Each router also used different expressions for the settings. Our goal is it to make you understand the settings so that you can easily fill out your own routers information for the port forwarding. In our sample we use the AVM Fritz!Box again to show you how to set it. To open the router just use the IP address which we filled in as gateway above and open it in the web browser. You should now see the login screen for your router. In the Fritz!Box you find this settings by clicking Internet - Portfreigabe. Normally all routers need the same following data. Application: There are a lot of presets which you can choose from. Such as HTTP Server, Webserver or others. We recommend to make a custom rule each time instead of using a preset rule. Name: This is only important if you are using more then one camera so that you can differentiate later between the different cameras. You can name it for example with the camera name or the camera location. Protocol: The camera only needs the TCP protocol. You don't need to forward UDP traffic. From (external) Port: This is the external (WAN) Port with which you can access the camera later through the internet. If you are only using one camera it is best to set it as 80. If you are using more then one camera you have to increase the port for each camera. So the second camera would use the Port 8081 for example. To (external) Port: Some routers might use Port 80 as the Service Port. If so you have to use Port 8081 for the first camera. IP Address: Here you have to fill in the IP address from the camera. To (internal) Port: This is the internal Port of the camera which we have set up earlier. If you are using a different Port then 80 inside your network then you have to set it here accordingly. We recommend to use Port 80 at this moment. If you want to set up more then one camera you have to make sure that for each camera you will create a port rule in your router. The external Port has to be unique for every camera. We recommend to increase the Port number by one. So first camera is using Port 80 and the second one should use Port 81 and the third camera Port 82 and so on. After you created the Port rule for each camera you should type in the DDNS address + the Port number. For example: xxxxx.ddns-instar.com:80 Excursus: To access your camera you can always use the same DDNS address. So if you have more then one camera you only need to remember one address. Most important is that you change the port behind the DDNS number. The reason behind it is that your internet service provider is assigning you a new IP address every 24 hours. Once the address is changed the camera notices this and sents it to the server in order to connect it to our DDNS address. This way you can always access your camera with one address even so the IP behind it changes. So even if you are using different DDNS addresses they all link to one address. So with every address you will access your router. And because of the port forwarding your router then knows to which device you want to be forwarded to. So for example we type the following to access the cameras: Camera 1: d2908.ddns-instar.com:80 Camera 2: d2908.ddns-instar.com:8081 Camera 3: d2908.ddns-instar.com:8082 and so on. Note: If you are using a Fritz!Box or a Netgear Router you can test the connection from within your own network. Most other routers do not support this function. So it is necessary to test it from outside your network. For example from a friends computer or from your computer at work. If you try this with Port 80 and you access your router instead of the camera then you might try to use Port 8081 since it could be that 80 is the service port of your router. If you are using a smartphone App you normally have to fill in the DDNS number instead of the normal IP address and also the Port through which you access the camera. You can also check the user manuals for our Windows Phone, iOS and Android App.","link": "/Internet_Access/The_DDNS_Service","title2": "Der DDNS Dienst","chapter": "Internet Access","tags": ["internet", "access", "ddns", "port", "forwarding", "router", "internet access"],"image": "/images/Search/InstarWiki_SearchThumb_DDNSService.jpg","abstract": "Access your Camera over it's Internet Address" ,"suggest" : {"input": [ "ddns", "internet access", "port", "forwarding", "router"],"output": "Access your Camera over it's Internet Address","payload" : { "articleId" : 1074 },"weight" : 10}}

Every website sits behind a number - it´s IP address - and the DNS servers of the internet allow you to connect to them without memorizing them. Whenever you type google.com into your browsers address bar, your computer or smartphone calls out and checks the domain name directories of the internet for the corresponding IP address. An IP address is a unique number that allows computers to locate each other on a network. The Internet is a big network and uses IP addresses to route communication to the proper host. The IP in IP address stands for Internet Protocol. What is this DDNS all about? Why do we hide the real addresses of our websites behind domain names? Firstly, the IP addresses are a bit difficult to memorize for organic brains like ours. And secondly, the IP address of a web site might change over time. The latter is a smaller problem for Google - they pay for the IP addresses and they will keep them for a while - but it is a big problem if you want to use an IP camera at home (or in general a local webserver for that matter). Your router is assigned a WAN IP address (Wide Area Network) by your internet services provider. This is your telephone number that allows you to call home when your are at work. You can check your personal WAN IP by opening a web site like wieistmeineip.de. You can check the IP address of your websites yourself, by typing nslookup into your command prompt and then the web domain you want to check. In this case we found that one of the IP address of google.com is 173.194.127.160. So if checking your WAN IP address is so simple, why not write it down and just use it to connect to your camera? The problem is, that your WAN IP address usually changes every 24hrs. You can usually buy static IP addresses from your provider - but if you don´t want to spend extra money on that, you would have to check your WAN IP address every morning before leaving your house. Having a static domain name that is automatically updated with the newest WAN IP address of your router every time the address changes starts to sound tempting? Why would I want to have a Third Party DDNS Address? That is why we already installed a DDNS address on your INSTAR camera. You can always use this service to connect to your camera from the internet (IF you have a port forwarding set up inside your router!). So why would you want to have a third party DDNS address running to connect to your camera? Every INSTAR camera comes with a preinstalled DDNS address so you don´t have to worry about the things we talk about here. In the INSTAR DDNS address seen above instar01 is your cameras personal host, the ddns3-instar.de is the domain of our DDNS server and the complete address instar01.ddns3-instar.de is called the hostname of your address. For security reasons, the host part installed on your camera is generated randomly and cannot be traced back to your purchase. And the domain name is given by the server your camera is registered to. This means you don´t have any control over your camera´s hostname. We already try to make them as easy to remember as possible - but maybe you just want to have a personalize address? Or being able to access your camera at any time is very important and you are looking for redundancy? That is where third party supplier will come in handy. So just hop to a website like www.noip.com, create a account and install it on your camera? Well yes, that is possible. But the interesting part is that you don´t have to deactivate your INSTAR DDNS address in your camera to use a third party one. You can set it up inside your router, on a webserver that is running all the time anyway or on the surveillance station ( QNAP or Synology) you use with your camera. This way you can have a personalized, and easy to remember, hostname - but still have your INSTAR address as a fall back option. And yes, you heard right! You just need one DDNS address, that is either maintained by your camera or your router, to connect to any device inside your local network. As we discussed earlier, the DDNS hostname is fancy way of writing down your routers WAN IP address. So, even if you have 5 INSTAR cameras running in your network, every single one of those DDNS addresses will just lead you to your router. The router then decides, based on the port the request is coming from, which cameras should be called. So basically, you only have to memorize 1 DDNS address and vary the port to call different cameras: Camera 1: instar01.ddns3-instar.de:8081, Camera 2: instar01.ddns3-instar.de:8082, Camera 3: instar01.ddns3-instar.de:8083. For information on how to forward these ports and why you should choose ports above 8080, please read on in our port forwarding article that will walk you through the setup for a couple of standard internet routers. In the following we will set up 3 different third party DDNS addresses on different systems. You will see that setting up the hostname and using it with an update service on your router or any other system is very easy and the steps are always the same - no matter what provider and hardware you plan to use. We choose those three providers because they offer free hostnames for you to experiment with.

Opening specific ports can allow web servers (like your camera), BitTorrent clients, games, and other applications to work through the usual security of your router that otherwise does not permit connections to these ports. Connect to your Camera over the Internet: Software ports are numbered connections that a computer uses to sort types of network traffic. A few services, such as FTP on port 21 and HTTP on port 80, are assigned by default to open ports where operating systems can find them easily. When a port is opened, a service, such as a the web user interface of your IP camera, is assigned to it. For security, by default all ports to the Internet and most LAN ports are closed so that traffic cannot flow through them. Which is why you cannot connect to your camera via the internet (DDNS) address. Connect to your Routers Interface Enter your router’s IP address into the address bar of a web browser. This will open your router’s configuration page. For most routers, this will be 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1 or 192.168.178.1. If you don´t know the exact IP address of your router you can use your command prompt or terminal to determine it. The router’s IP address is usually the same as the Default Gateway - at least in home and small business networks. For Windows: Open the command prompt and enter ipconfig all. For Mac: Open the terminal and enter netstat -nr. For Linux: Open the terminal and enter route. The Default Gateway of your home or small business network is most likely the IP address of your router. Access your Router: If you've already configured the security settings for your router, enter the username and password you chose then. If not, check the sticker on your router for a device password (this is not the same as the WiFi password!). In case you cannot find a password, try typing in default password + your routers model number into the search engine of your liking - for example GOOGLE. The default password for your router should be among the first few page hits. There are also websites devoted to this problem - you can check portforward.com or routerpasswords.com for your router model. If you've forgotten your login information, you can press the reset button on your router to reset it to factory defaults. You can then look up the factory default settings online. Type in your router login to access the configuration interface. Access your Router: Find the Port Forwarding section - Each router will be slightly different. Common labels are Port Forwarding, Applications, Gaming, Virtual Servers, Freigaben, Spiele und Anwendungen, Portweiterleitung, NAT Firewall. If you don't see one of these or something similar, try Advanced Settings and look for a Port Forwarding subsection. Once you found the section, enter a name for the service - e.g. INSTAR camera. Then choose the service type - This can be TCP, UDP, or both. Your IP camera only needs the TCP protocol. Then select the ports you wish to use. For your camera you have to open it´s web http internal port that you can set in the camera webUI under Network IP Configuration. If you want to access the RTSP stream of an HD camera model you will have to forward the corresponding RTSP port. Now select the IP address of your camera and assign the port forwarding to it. This is the IP address that is displayed by the INSTAR camera tool and that you can see in your browsers address bar when you accessed the camera´s web user interface. How this looks like strongly depends on the router and firmware version you are using. In the following we will discuss the necessary steps for the most common routers in home networks. If your router is not among this selection please read on on portforward.com that has a much larger collection of router example available. Portforwarding: The steps of forwarding a port to your camera are mostly the same in every router. In the following we present a few examples from common router manufacturer.

For more general information about the ddns access please refer to HERE. The following text will show you how to set up an AVM Fritzbox to allow you to access your camera when you are not at home. General Recommendation INSTAR VGA camera live streams can only be accessed via the HTTP port (default 80) that is also used by the web user interface (webUI). In case of an INSTAR HD camera you can also use the RTSP stream that is transported via a different port (default 554). It is recommended not to open the default ports to the internet - as this can make your local network vulnerable against attacks. There is also a problem that default ports might be used by different services and not be available. Some internet provider even block all ports from 1 - 1024, forcing you to use a much higher port for your camera. Fortunately, there are plenty of ports to choose from - 65536 ( 216 ) to be specific. We recommend you try using a port that is bigger than 8080 - the last port that is regularly used by web based services. Please keep in mind that changing the default HTTP port of your camera forces you to add this new port to the IP address of your camera separated by a : if you want to access the web user interface with your browser locally - e.g. 192.168.178.199:8081. It might, therefore, be more convenient to forward the RTSP port instead and access the camera through our smartphone app as RTSP camera. This way you will not be able to access the cameras webUI - but this can be an advantage from a security point of view. Fritzbox 7490 Set your Camera Ports First, take a look at your cameras HTTP and - in case of a HD model - RTSP port. As mentioned above, they can be changed to non-default port. Remember the port you have chosen and open your router in a new tab - the default IP address is 192.168.178.1, alternatively, you can type fritz.box to navigate to the user interface. The default login is username = admin and the password is provided on a sticker at the back of your FritzBox. You HD cameras live stream is accessible via two ports that can be forwarded. For VGA cameras you only have to worry about the HTTP port. Open the router web user interface via the default IP address 192.168.178.1 or by typing fritz.box into the address bar of your browser. Setup a Portforwarding Rule Go to Internet Freigaben and click on Neue Portfreigabe. Choose Andere Anwendung from the drop down menu. To forward a port open Internet Freigaben and click on Neue Portfreigabe. Now fill out the following dialogue: Portfreigabe aktiv für: Choose Andere Anwendung. Bezeichnung: Here you can choose a name for the port forwarding. If you have more then one port forwarding we recommend you to use a unique name. Protokoll: Please select TCP. von Port: Choose the port you set inside your camera - HTTP or RTSP. Remember that every camera needs a unique port - you cannot use the same port for different cameras. Remember to add the Port at the end of your cameras internet address if you want to access it from another place. For example if your camera uses Port 8081 you have to type (xxx.ddns-instar.com:8081). bis Port: Here you can fill in the same Port as in von Port or you can leave it blank. an IP Adresse: Please fill in the IP address which your camera is using. This is the same address which you are using to access your camera through the web browser in your local network. It should start with 192.168.178.x. If you cannot find the camera´s IP in the drop-down menu, choose Manuelle Eingabe and type it in manually. Fill out the remaining fields according to the information above. Repeat those steps for the second port if you choose to forward both the HTTP and RTSP port for your camera. In the example above, the HD camera can now be reached from the internet via the HTTP port 8081 - just type in your camera´s DDNS address (XXXXXX.ddns-instar.com) - you can find it in the camera´s webUI under Network DDNS - into our smartphone app and add the web port 8081 in the field underneath. If you choose to add the camera via it´s RTSP stream - choose the camera model with the added (RTSP) from the drop down menu - type in the RTSP port 51001 instead. Fritzbox 7390 To access the user interface of your router open the following address with your internet browser 192.168.178.1 . The default login is username = admin and the password is provided on a sticker at the back of your FritzBox. Navigate to the menu Internet and then Freigaben as shown below to fill in the following data: Portfreigabe aktiv für: Either you choose Portfreigabe aktiv für or Andere Anwendung. Bezeichnung: Here you can choose a name for the port forwarding. If you have more then one port forwarding we recommend you to use a unique name. Protokoll: Please select TCP. von Port: lease choose 80 as the Port. If you are already using this Port for another camera or Server you can also choose another Port. If you are using more then one Port you have to remember to add the Port at the end of your cameras Internet address if you want to access it from another place. For example if your camera uses Port 81 you have to type (xxx.ddns-instar.com:81). bis Port: Here you can fill in the same Port as in von Port or you can leave it blank. an IP Adresse: Please fill in the IP address which your camera is using. This is the same address which you are using to access your camera through the web browser in your local network. It should start with 192.168.178.x. an Port: Please fill in Port 80. Troubleshooting: As mentioned above, choosing the right port for your camera is vital. The default ports work most of the time - but if they don´t, it can be very difficult to figure out who the culprit is. It is best to choose a port outside of the regular range of web ports if you run into problems. Especially, mobile internet providers often block ports up to 1024 or even to 8080. Mobile access points - 3G LTE routers that are operated via SIM cards - often do not provide a public IP address that is needed for the DDNS service. If you are using mobile internet and you cannot connect to your camera from external network, check if your contract offers a static WAN IP address. This is often provided with Business Packages but not available for lower priced contracts. A public address for your router is mandatory for the DDNS access to work! Another problem are so called DS-Lite (Dual Stack Lite) connections - it is, in general impossible, to access your camera via DDNS if your provider assigns you a DSLite connection. You can check if this is the case by checking if you have an IPv6 address next to your normal IPv4 address. The solution for both the missing public IP and DSLite tunnels is a new technology that was added to the HD camera line. All INSTAR HD cameras come with a Point-2-Point UserID (P2P UID) that allows you to connect our mobile app to the camera without the need of a port forwarding. This technology will work behind mobile access points without a public IP as well as behind DSLite IPv6 connections. Another Problem might be the parental control settings inside your router. Please check if your camera is allowed to connect to the internet in the Kindersicherung (Parental Control) section: Click on Kindersicherung on the main page, or go to Internet Filter and check if there are any restrictions active for your camera. If yes, click on the pencil button to lift the restriction (choose Unbeschränkt). Adding More Cameras: If you are using more then one camera you have to also create another Port rule for each camera.Please make sure that the Öffentliche Port is always different for each port forwarding. For example if you are using Port 8081 for the first camera then the second camera should have the Port 8082 and the third camera Port 8083 and so on. To access each camera you would type in something like this: Camera 1: ab1234.ddns-instar.com:8081, Camera 2: ab1234.ddns-instar.com:8082 and so on... Note: You can access all cameras with only one internet address. Only the Port at the end has to be changed. Therefore, you do not have to remember all DDNS addresses of the camera. You only need to remember one address. Port Forwarding :: AVM Fritzbox To access your camera through the internet you will need a portforwarding service inside your router.

Go to Netzwerk NAT und Portregeln to set a new port forwarding rule for your camera. Auswahl: Here please do not choose anything. Or you could choose HTTP Server which will use the default web port 80. Bezeichnung: Here please choose a name for the forwarding rule. For example IP Camera or Instar. Gültig für Gerät: Now please choose the device name or the IP address of your IP camera. This should be the same address that you are using in order to open your IP camera in the web browser. Mostly this address should start with 192.168.2.x. Umgeleitete Ports - Öffentlich: Please choose 80 as your port. If you do not want to choose Port 80 you have to make sure that later when you try to access the camera that you also have to type in the Port in the address bar with : for example xxx.ddns-instar.com:87 in case you are using Port 87. Umgeleitete Ports - Private Client: As default you can fill in 80. If you are using InstarVision and you want to do Portforwarding to the integrated web server you also have to fill in 80 if you didnt change the Port inside the software. Telekom Speedport (900 Series): To access the user interface of your router open the following address with your internet browser 192.168.2.1. The default login can be found on a sticker on the back of the router. Navigate to the Portfreischaltung in the Internet tab. Click on Weitere TCP Umleitung anlegen and pick your cameras IP address from the drop-down menu. You can find your cameras IP address using our IP Camera Tool. Type your cameras port - the default port is 80 - into all 3 fields and click Speichern to save the service. Go to Internet Portfreischaltung to set a new port forwarding rule for your camera. Your camera can now be reached via the ddns address that can be found under System Info in your cameras user interface (s. above). In case the port 80 is already taken in your network you will have to change the camera port under Network Basic Network Settings and of course adjust the portforwarding service to the new port. Use your personal internet address under System Info in the cameras web user interface to your camera from the road. Adding More Cameras: If you are using more then one camera you have to also create another Port rule for each camera.Please make sure that the Öffentliche Port is always different for each port forwarding. For example if you are using Port 8081 for the first camera then the second camera should have the Port 8082 and the third camera Port 8083 and so on.

So that camera takes the last picture and compares it with the new one. This will also have the effect that the camera will notice a change of brightness in the picture in the same way as it notices a person or object moving through the picture. With the sensitivity you can set how many percentage of a picture has to change until the camera will cause an alarm. HD Camera Series: To activate the motion detection, open the web interface of your INSTAR HD IP camera and click on the menu Alarm Areas. You can select which area of the video the motion detection should be armed in the Areas Overlay. Therefore please select the Area on the right side for which you want to do the settings. Next please click Active. You will see that the area which you have set to Active is now showing a colour. Also on top the number for the area activated will light up in red to symbolize that this area is active. By simply clicking into the picture and dragging your mouse you can choose the area for motion detection. The motion detection will be armed in the area you have selected. In case you want to select the whole area you can click Full Area on the right side in order to activate the motion detection over the whole picture. Now you can use the slide bar to set the sensitivity for the motion. 1 = Insensitive (almost no motion gets detected) 100 = Very Sensitive (almost every motion will be recorded). We recommend you so leave the motion sensitivity at 50 and slowly test which setting will deliver the best result. Repeat the above steps in case you want to set more then one area. Each area will be given a different colour: Area 1 = red, Area 2 = blue, Area 3 = green, Area 4 = yellow. Submit the settings in order to save all settings in the camera. You will need to select an Action so that the camera knows what it should do in case of an alarm. Please open the menu Alarm Actions. Here you can now set if the camera should sent you an email with snapshots in the attachment or if the pictures should be saved to an SD card or an FTP server. In order to save pictures or videos to an SD card please make sure an SD card in inserted in your camera. Finally please Submit the settings. Attention: If you have problems by receiving to many alarms you can solve that by doing different settings. Always set the sensitivity so the motion you want to detect can be detected by the camera. Usually this will be humans that need to be detected. Just simply use a setting so that the motion that is caused by a human will be detected soon enough to cause an alarm. So if the settings are currently 5 and you notice that sometimes that motion gets not detected simply change it to 6 as we recommend so that should solve the problem. To avoid unwanted motion detection please try to make sure that areas like the sky with moving clouds, streets in the background or big reflecting areas and others are not part of the are the camera is protecting. To find the right camera position you can change the viewing angle a little bit or mount the camera on a different area which suits better to protects you home. This can reduce the quantity of false alarms enormously. VGA Camera Series: To activate the motion detection, open the web interface of your INSTAR VGA IP camera and click on the menu Alarm Alarm. 1 = nonsensitive (almost no motion gets detected) 10 = very sensitive (almost every motion will be recorded). We recommend you so set the motion sensitivity to 6. The cameras integrated motion detection only works over the whole picture. With our additional software InstarVision for Windows computers you can define different areas in the picture for which you want to use motion detection. That means not the whole picture will be included in the motion detection but only the areas you have selected. For other operating system we currently have to use third party developers such as the software Motion, EvoCam, ZoneMinder, VitaminD and many others. The use of third party software is no problem with our cameras since they are integrated in most software versions. If you find that our cameras are not integrated you can contact us anytime so we can arrange the integration. Please note that the software of third party developers are only working with the livestream of the camera. So in order to use the functions offered by the third party software you need to have your computer running and the software opened.

To find the right camera position you can change the viewing angle a little bit or mount the camera on a different area which suits better to protects you home. This can reduce the quantity of false alarms enormously. As soon as you camera is detection a motion you have 3 options in order to get a notification or to record the motion: 1. Email: The IP camera will automatically sent you an email with 6 pictures in the attachment. The computer does not need to run for this function since the camera has a direct connection to the router. 2. FTP Upload: The IP camera will sent pictures to your FTP Server. With this function there will be pictures saved for a time period of 1 minute in case of an alarm. The computer does not need to run for this function. Alternative: The FTP Upload gives you the additional function to upload pictures in a fixed time interval. With this function you can for example have one picture saved every 10 seconds for an unlimited time. The picture can either be saved with the same name or the name can be created by the camera automatically by using date and time as the picture name. 3. Video: A 1 minute video can be automatically recorded. This function is only working if you are using the Internet Explorer as a webbrowser since a ActiveX Plugin is necessary to record the video to your computer. So in order to save the video the computer needs to be running and the IP address of the camera has to be opened in Internet Explorer showing the livestream. If you use our addtional software InstarVision you can also record videos. Also you can record them with a high compression and in different video formats in order to save space on your harddrive. Alternative: You can also make a continues recording with the Internet Explorer. Therefor just activate the recording manually by pressing the record button on the upper left side.","link": "/Motion_Detection/Setup/", "title2": "Aktivieren Sie die Bewegungserkennung Ihrer Kamera", "chapter": "Motion Detection","tags": ["motion detection", "alarm", "notification", "email", "detection areas", "FTP"],"image": "/images/Search/##################","abstract": "Set up the Motion Detection Function" ,"suggest" : {"input": [ "motion detection", "email notification", "ftp upload", "areas", "schedule" ],"output": "Set up the Motion Detection Function", "payload" : { "articleId" : 1086 },"weight" : 1}}

Step 1: In order that the camera can sent you pictures by email you have to save your email providers data inside the camera. This can be done if you open the web interface of your IP camera and then click on Alarm in order to open the SMTP Server. On the upcoming overlay you now have to fill in the following data: SMTP Server: Here you have to fill in the SMTP Server from your email provider. Mostly you can find this data on the website of your email provider by searching for SMTP. Otherwise you find a list HERE. SMTP Port: Fill in the Port which your email provider is using. Normally this will be either Port 25, 465 or 587. SSL: Here you can activate if your account is using SSL encryption. SMTP Login Type: For almost all email servers this has to be set to Authentication so that you can identify yourself with your username and password. SMTP Username: Please fill in the username of your email account. SMTP Password: Please fill in the password of your email account. Please enter your email accounts SMTP data and your personal login and save all settings by clicking Submit. Step 2: Next please open the Alarm Email Overlay to set the receiver and the sender of the alarm emails. Please fill in all necessary data: Sender: Please fill in your email address. This can be the same email address as the receiver. Receiver: Please fill in the email address that should receive the alarm message. Email Subject: The subject will be shown in every email you receive. Email Text: Will be shown together with the alarm pictures in each email. To save all settings please press Submit. You will now be able to test the settings. Step 3: To receive emails in case of an alarm you will need to activate the motion detection in your camera and select what the camera should do in case of an alarm. All necessary settings are explained HERE. If you need help with any kind of settings please feel free to contact us any time. VGA Camera Series - Setting up and activating the email alarm. Step 1: In order that the camera can sent you pictures by email you have to save your email providers data inside the camera. This can be done if you open the web interface of your IP camera and then click on Alarm in order to open the Email Menu. On the right side you now have to fill in the following data: Sender: Please fill in your email address. This can be the same email address as the receiver. Receiver 1: Please fill in the email address that should receive the alarm message. SMTP Server: Here you have to fill in the SMTP Server from your email provider. Mostly you can find this data on the website of your email provider by searching for SMTP. Otherwise you find a list HERE. SMTP Port: Fill in the Port which your email provider is using. Normally this will be either Port 25, 465 or 587. Transport Layer Security Protocol: You only need this if you are using Gmail as your email provider. Please choose either TLS or STARTTLS depending on which one you are using. Need Authentication: For almost all email servers this has to be activated so that you can identify yourself with your username and password. SMTP User: Please fill in the username of your email account. SMTP Password: Please fill in the password of your email account. Report Internet IP by Mail: This function can normally be deactivated. If you activate this service the camera will sent you always the newest internet IP address. Every 24 hours your ISP changes your IP address so the camera will always sent you the newest one. Since the camera has a integrated DDNS address this function is normally not needed. Now please save all settings by clicking Submit. After submitting the data to the camera we recommend you to click Test in order to see if the data you typed in was right. Step 2: After you have now saved all email settings in your camera you still have to activate the email alarm in order to receive an alarm email when a motion is detected. Therefor please click Alarm and choose Alarm in the sub menu. In the next window please set Motion Detect Armed and activate Send E-Mail on Alarm as show in the screenshot below. After that please choose Submit to save the settings. If your camera detects a motion you will now be informed with a email and 6 pictures in the attachment. Notes: Please note that the camera can not detect weather it is a human motion or a motion caused by heavy rain or fast light changes. Depending how many false alarms you will receive you might change the sensibility a little. (1= insensitive and 10= very sensitive). Troubleshooting - Gmail Problem: You set up a new GMail account just for your camera´s alarm notifications. But the Test-Email always fails because of a faulty authentication. Solution: Google monitors your behaviour to estimate if it is really you, who accesses the email account. When you use a new device - e.g. another smartphone or your IP camera - to login to your account, Google might block you and ask for a two stage authentication. This will cause your Test-Email to fail. Please log into your account via your web browser and and check if your GMail account was blocked or Google tells you they caught a suspicious activity. Just authenticate yourself and or the device that caused the activity. Problem: GMail always worked fine, but now you stopped receiving alarm emails. But you are still receiving emails from other senders in your GMail account. Solution: GMail started to limit the amount of emails that you are allowed to send with a free account. Your camera is using the GMail SMTP server to send alarm emails and is therefore using up the amount of mails you are allowed to send. You can set up a separate GMail account for your camera to avoid this interference with your personal emails. Problem: You cannot send a Test Email - the login fails. Solution: Activate the SMTP access for less secure apps. Open on your Email Account menu, choose Account to open your Account Settings and go to the Sign In Settings and allow the access from less secure apps. Telekom Speedport: Problem: You are using your camera behind a Telekom Speedport and typed in your SMTP server and login credentials but the Test-Email always fails. Solution: The Telekom Speedport introduced a list of allowed SMTP servers into it´s Firmware, which is activated by default. Even though this list contains most common SMTP servers - it might still interfere with your attempts to contact SMTP servers with your camera. You can deactivate the Email Abuse Detection for a moment (maybe restart your Speedport afterwards) and try again. Deactivate the Mail Abuse Detection and re-try sending your Test-Email. If it works, add your SMTP server address to the list of allowed addresses and activate the function again. T-Online Mail: Problem: You set up a new T-Online mail account just for your camera´s alarm notifications. But the Test-Email always fails because of a faulty authentication. Solution: You need to set a separate email password for external apps to connect to your T-Online mail account. Log in to your T-Online web account and open then Menu Properties.

To quickly access your recordings, click on the SD Card link inside your cameras web user interface. Or use a third-party Software to download the video. SD Card Access: The HD camera models use an internal (removable) SD card to record videos, alarm snapshots and whole photo series that can be used for later time lapse conversions. You can access the recorded files directly via the cameras web user interface or with an FTP client. The webUI is the quickest way to download files and screen them on your computer, tablet or smartphone from your default web browser. But FTP clients offer a few features that will be more convenient if you have to go through a large number of files from your SD card. Please be aware that the FTP client has to support the hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP) to access the SD card. Please be aware that you will only be able to download files - the FTP clients will not offer your WRITE rights on the SD storage! Below you can find a short selection of clients that will work with your INSTAR camera. For indoor models you can always remove the SD card and use it with a card reader on your computer or mobile device for easy access. Web User Interface. The HD camera models allow you to record videos and snapshots to the internal SD card. To quickly access your recordings, click on the SD Card link inside your cameras web user interface. Click on the SD Card link above your cameras live video. Web User Interface. The SD cards file directory will open in a new tab. Please type in your camera login to access your recorded files. If the link is not displayed the SD is no longer mounted by the cameras operating system - please remove the SD card and push it back into the SD card slot. You are able to screen and download your recordings after confirming your camera login. SD Card Index. Your camera generates a new directory for each new day and a new recordXXX directory for every 200 recordings of that day. Every alarm event creates an *.avi file that starts with the capital letter A - planned recordings with the letter P and so on - followed by a timecode for the alarm trigger. File System. The default behavior of most internet browsers is to download the video after you clicked on it. Browsers like the Mozilla Firefox off you support for the VLC plugin to display the video directly inside the browser window. Please make sure that you activate the Firefox plugin during the installation process of the VLC player and restart your browser after the installation.

Step 1 Open the web interface of your HD IP cam and click Alarm - FTP. Step 2 The following settings need to be done in the overlay which will open. FTP Server: Please enter the address of your FTP server. In the example above we have used a AVM Fritzbox (Router) as a FTP server. This router has a USB Stick connected which provides the storage for the pictures. In our case we have to type in the IP address of the router. If you want to set up your own FTP server on your local computer you will find a step by step manual here. You can also use a web address as the FTP Server. This can either be a online host service or a DynDns address which connects to a FTP server at another location. FTP Port: Please type in the FTP Servers port which is usually 21. FTP Folder: Fill in the folder you want to upload the pictures inside. By default the folder will be which means that the camera will save the uploads in the root folder of the server. In our above sample the pictures will be saved in the root folder. FTP Username: Please fill in the username of your FTP account. The default username for the AVM Fritzbox is ftpuser. FTP Password: Please fill in the password of your FTP account. FTP Mode: Here you can choose between (PASV) and active Mode (PORT). The default setting is the mode PORT with which the camera will tell the server its IP and Port. Therefor this mode will also work with passive FTP servers. If the client is behind a router which will use NAT or if a firewall is blocking the clients network from accessing the network then you should choose the PASV mode. Next please submit all settings and test them afterwards to make sure the settings are correct. Step 3 Please open the menu Alarm Actions. Step 4 In the Overlay which opens please select what the camera should do in case of an motion alarm. The camera can upload pictures to an FTP Server when a motion is triggered. In total 4 pictures will be uploaded in which you can see the object that caused the motion. All pictures will be uploaded in the full HD resolution 1280 x 720. You can also upload videos to your FTP server. Therefor you will need to insert a SD card into your camera. The video will then be recorded to the SD card and uploaded to your FTP server. You find more information about the settings for motion detection HERE. Step 5 In addition to the upload during an alarm you can also upload pictures in a time interval. Thanks to this function you can create time laps recordings. Please open the menu Alarm Photo Series. Step 6 Please activate that you want to have a photo series uploaded to an FTP server. Next you can choose if the picture should be uploaded with a new file name each time (timestamp) or if you want to have a fixed file name and the file will be replaced each time. Also you can set the time interval in which the picture should be uploaded. The smallest value is 1 second but it also depends on the upload speed of your internet connection.

This storage spaces can be written on by FTP clients like your INSTAR IP camera. All you need to do is to provide the storage and set up a FTP user inside your router and the camera can send snapshots - or in case of the HD cameras even whole video files - to the router. This can be vital if your camera or the included SD card (HD camera line) gets damaged and you want to figure out what happened. Of course you don´t need to upload those backup files to your local router - if you have a router in a different location, you can easily use it as an off-site storage backup system for your surveillance system!

The user interface screenshots will only show the AVM UI. But most of the steps we will take are representative for other routers as well. Each time, you will need to define a FTP user and the corresponding access rights inside the router. Then type in the FTP user credentials and the corresponding FTP directory into your camera´s WebUI. Set up an Upload Directory. First we have to set up a directory for your camera´s uploads. Connect an USB thumbdrive or an USB hard drive to the USB port of your router. In case of the Fritzbox simply click on FritzNAS (on top of the screen) to enter the storage overview panel. For other routers it is recommended to check the FTP access with an FTP client like Filezilla Client or simply type in ftp IP of your router 21 into the address bar of your default web browser. Use the camera login we just created to check available storage. If you are using Firefox, you can use a FTP client extension like FireFTP to create a directory that your camera should use to upload files. Once inside the FritzNAS storage overview window, change to your external storage (in our case a ADATA Thumbdrive), click on the New Folder button on top and create a new folder for your camera. Remember the path to your folder as we will have to type it into camera webUI in moment. Be carful not to delete the FRITZ folder, created by your router - if you do, your thumb drive will be unmounted and you have to replug it into the USB Port! Add a directory for your camera on your external storage medium to write her files to. Set up a FTP User - First, we have to find the FTP settings inside the router. For most routers that is pretty straight-forward - just search for the keyword FTP. Unfortunately, AVM decided to hide this function with the newer firmwares, causing us a little bit of a headache. Which is partly the reason why we take the Fritzbox router as the example - the other routers will be much easier to set up. The FTP are now hidden inside the Fritzbox User (Benutzer) tab under System. Click on Add User (Benutzer Hinzufügen) and give your user a name and password. It is recommended to keep the name and password secure but to stay away from exotic characters, which might cause you some trouble. Especially, if you only use the FTP upload inside your local network and you deactivate the access rights from the internet (Zugang aus dem Internet, s. screenshot below). The only thing your cameras needs to have access to is the network attached storage (Zugang zu NAS-Inhalten, s. below). Click on add a directory (Verzeichnis Hinzufügen) and allow the camera to write onto the supplied storage. Add a FTP user on your router so your camera has access to the network attached storage. Choosing Alle an der Fritzbox verfügbaren Speicher allows the camera to write into every directory on your router. It is very important, that the user authentication is active on your router - the camera will not be able to upload the files to the storage otherwise. As seen in the screenshots below, you will now have an administrator account to manage your router as well as the pure FTP user for your camera. You can switch to the tab Anmeldung im Heimnetz to confirm that the authentication is active or not... Well, you will already know if you had to login to your router earlier anyway. Check the screenshots below for the Fritzbox example. Please make sure that you also have a administrator account active and the user authentication is activated - this is very important and a common mistake! Set up your Camera to use the FTP Storage. Now we can access our camera to program it to upload files to our new FTP upload directory in case of an alarm event. Open the web user interface of your camera and navigate to Alarm FTP. The following menu (see 2nd screenshot below) needs to be filled with all the data we just set up inside the router: FTP Server: Is the address of the FTP server. In our case the IP address of our router 192.168.178.1. Please be aware that the IP addresses of routers from different manufactures will vary. Usually it is only the third number that will be different - in most cases it is either 0, 1, 2 or in case of the AVM Fritzbox 178. FTP Port: The default FTP port is 21. FTP Folder: The FTP folder is the upload directory we just set up on our router. Please remember to add a in front of the folder. If you want to upload to the root directory, just put a here. FTP Username: Put in the username we just defined inside the router FTP Password: and add the corresponding password. FTP Mode: The default mode for a local FTP server - that isn´t shielded by a NAT firewall - is PASV. Afterwards click on Submit and Test to check your inputs. Your camera should give you a Successful notification and if you check your upload directory, you will find a snapshot uploaded by the camera. Now you can activate the FTP upload actions in case of an alarm trigger event, to have the camera upload it snapshots or videos to your FTP server. Configure your Camera. Open your cameras web user interface and go to Alarm FTP to input your FTP server information you set up earlier. WebUI Type in your FTP login credentials and server information like described above. Submit before testing the upload. FTP Settings You will find a single snapshot in your upload directory, after successfully testing the FTP connection.

Step 3: On the left side please click on Network and within the network services please switch the IPv4 Network Mode to static. This is important to make sure that the ip address of your MyCloud is not changing. If you are noting switching it to static, it could be that your router will assign a different IP address to your MyCloud. In this case the camera would not be able to reach it anymore and therefor will not record anymore to the MyCloud. Therefor this step is very important. Step 4: Follow the assistent to assign a static IP address. You actually only have to click on Next and Apply in order to apply the settings. Please remember the IP address shown in Step2. This IP address will be the one with which you can access your WD MyCloud at any time. Step 5: You have to login again once the IP has been changed to a static IP. Please login in again. Once logged in, please click the right arrow again in the upper menue and click on Settings. Step 6: Once again select Network and within the network services please switch the FTP Access to ON. ON should then be shown in blue. Step 7: The FTP Access in general is now activated. In order to tell the camera in which folder it should record, we will need to set up a shared Folder. Therefor please click on Shares in the upper menue and inside this menue please click on the + sign in order to add a shared Folder. Step 8: For Share Name you can now type in the folder name in which you want the recordings beeing stored. In our case we choose the folder name Recordings. You can also add a description to the folder name. In our case we name it INSTAR Cameras. Once you typed in the Share Name and Desciption please Apply the settings. Step 9: The newly created shared Folder should now already be selected. In order to be able to access it by FTP, you will need to activate the FTP access. Please activate it. Now you still need to choose if a anonymous user can access the folder or not, in this case we recomment you to select Anonoymous None which means that noone can access the recordings besides you. Once done please click Apply. Step 10: Finally we have to set up our camera by typing in all the FTP data. To do so, please open the web interface of your INSTAR camera. You can either type in the IP address of your camera in the address bar of your web browser, or you can use the INSTAR camera tool to search for your camera and to open it in the default web browser. Once it is opened, please click on „Alarm – FTP“ on the left menue bar to open the FTP settings. Step 11: In the FTP mask please fill in the following data: FTP Server: Here you will need to type in the IP address of your WD MyCloud. As an alternative you can also type in wdmycloud.local FTP Port: Please leave it Port 21 which is used for FTP. FTP Folder: You will have to type in the folder name which you have created before as a shared Folder on your MyCloud. In our case it was the folder Recordings. If you are having more then one camera, we recommend you to also add another sub folder for each camera, in our case Camera_LivingRoom. This way it will be easier later to seperate between the different cameras. FTP Username: The username of your WD MyCloud. FTP Password: The password of your WD MyCloud. FTP Mode: Please keep this PASV Mode. FTP Folder Structure: Here you can select if the camera shoudl record everything in one single folder, or if the camera should create a new folder for each day.

The server needs a compatible software to recognize this request as an alarm event and trigger further actions. This function is often supported by home alarm systems. You can add custom commands to the request to trigger specific actions in the receiving server software. Add an Alarm Server: Open the web user interface of your (VGA!) camera and navigate to Alarm Alarm Server. Type in your in your alarm server address and activate the function. Please add the http prefix when entering the servers IP address - e.g. http: 192.168.1.66. Application: The Alarm Server function can be used with alarm systems and home automations like the Open Source project FHEM. Unfortunately, because those home automation systems insist on using SPACEs in their URLs, programing your camera becomes a little bit more complicated. As I am writing this article we are already testing a new version of the web user interface for our VGA camera´s that will make the work-around below superfluous. The following will show you how you are able to determin, if your camera is handling the command correctly and how to prepare your command to bypass the problem in case the camera is not saving it as expected. Home automation system´s like FHEM use SPACEs in their URLs that have to be encoded as %20. You have to use a so called URL encoding to employ SPACEs in your web address. An example command for the home automation system FHEM is set alarm on to trigger an alarm event. This will encode to set%20alarm%20on for the camera. The receiving FHEM server will then decode the %20 back to a SPACE. If, for example, your (FHEM) alarm server has the local IP address 192.168.1.66 inside your network, the Server Address you have to type in your cameras webUI to have it activate the alarm event will be. http: 192.168.1.66 fhem?cmd=set%20alarm%20on (The maximal length of the URL is 128 characters) You can check if the command was saved correctly by calling your cameras configuration with the CGI command http: 192.168.1.230 get_params.cgi (where 192.168.1.230 has to be changed to the IP address of your IP camera. You will be asked to log in with your camera administrator account, if you are not logged in already. Scroll to the bottom of the parameter list and search for the variable alarm_http_url. You can check if the server address and FHEM command was saved correctly by calling the cameras configuration page with the CGI command get_params.cgi. The server address has to be saved with the %20 encoding. Every time an alarm is triggered inside the camera the HTTP request will be send to your home automation server, triggering your custom command. Troubleshooting: What to do if your camera does not save the command with the %20 URL encoding? As mentioned above, you might already be using a camera where the web user interface takes care of the encoding for you and the command is saved correctly - please skip this paragraph if this is the case. In the following we will employ a little trick to make the encoding for us instead of against us. What to do if the CGI command get_params.cgi shows you that the camera saved the command with SPACEs instead of the %20 encoding?. Your camera will now send out the HTTP request every time the alarm is triggered. But the request will be cut before the first SPACE - making it basically useless. We can fix this dilemma by having the automatic URL encoding generate the correct URL for us. This can be done by encoding the % sign to %25. The server address will become: http: 192.168.1.66 fhem?cmd=set%2520alarm%2520on The automatic encoding will generate the correct address from it once you submit this address: http: 192.168.1.66 fhem?cmd=set%20alarm%20on To prevent this from happening, encode the SPACE with %2520 instead of %20.Please make sure not to press the Submit button a second time - as this will again get rid of the %20, substituting it with a SPACE. You can check the result by calling the get_params.cgi command.","link": "/Motion_Detection/Alarm_Server", "title2": "Alarm Server", "chapter": "Motion Detection","tags": ["local server", "motion detection", "home automation", "Alarm Server"],"image": "/images/Search/InstarWiki_SearchThumb_AlarmServer.jpg","abstract": "Alarm Server Function" ,"suggest" : {"input": [ "local server", "motion detection", "home automation", "Alarm Server" ],"output": "Alarm Server Function", "payload" : { "articleId" : 1105 },"weight" : 1}}

CGI: Common Gateway Interface. Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard method used to generate dynamic content on web pages. CGI provides an interface between the web server and programs that generate the web content. These programs are known as CGI scripts or simply CGIs. The CGI commands listed in the following allow you to directly communicate with your INSTAR IP camera through your web browser. Simply add your camera's IP address to the command submit it through your browser's address field. Like the camera's own web user interface, they can also be used embedded in HTML pages. 1080p Series - The INSTAR fullHD Series builds on the HighChip (HC) chipset that is modelled after the HighSilicon (HS) solution. The following commands can be applied to all camera models with a 1080p resolution. 720p Series - The current INSTAR HD Series builds on the Grainmedia (GM) chipset that is modelled after the HighSilicon (HS) solution. The following commands can be applied the both GM (like the IN-5907HD, IN-6012HD and IN-7011HD) and HS (IN-6011HD) camera models. VGA Series - The current INSTAR VGA Series builds on the Winbond (WB) chipset. The WB solution is very common among VGA IP cameras and following commands can, therefore be applied to a wide variety of cameras. The compatible INSTAR cameras are the 29xx series, the 30xx series and the 40xx series.

You can make various operations on the device by this set of CGI commands. CGI authentication: to access below CGI commands you need to authenticate your user level. Different CGI commands need different authority: visitor, operator or admin. The authentication is handled over the http protocol by attaching the user name and password directly to the CGI parameter. Example: cgi-bin hi3510 cleanlog.cgi?usr=admin&pwd=instar All the CGI commands support GET and POST operation - except upgrade.cgi and restore.cgi, which can only be used in a POST operation. GET Example: form name=form2 method= get action= cgi-bin hi3510 cleanlog.cgi input name=cururl type=hidden input name=name type=hidden value=access form POST Example: form name=form5 method=post target=retframe enctype = multipart form-data action=cgi-bin/hi3510/upgrade.cgi onSubmit=return upgrade() td colspan= 3 input type=filename =setting_file input type=submit value=submit form CGI Return： Depending on the returned info, the returns can be divided into two cases: GET CGI of device status and parameter, if successful，will return plain txt which includes the device status or parameter. The format is specified as javascript and every status or parameter as a variable： var bps_1=2048; var fps_1=25; var gop_1=50; var brmode_1=1; var imagegrade_1=1; var width_1=704; var height_1=576; if the GET fails, it will return：[Error]GET video attribution error! errcode is 0xa10e6008.Set device parameter will return plain txt including the result of the operation. If successful, the return will be HTTP 1.0 200 OK.

SMA (SubMiniature version A) And RP-SMA (Reversed Polarity SubMiniature version A) have a 50 Ω impedance and are designed for use with frequencies up to 18 GHz. The SMA connector employs a 1 4 - 36 thread and the male is equipped with a 5 16 hex nut and are one of the most commonly used RF/microwave connectors. SMA Antenna Connector: A RP-SMA antenna (IN-3010) on the left and a SMA antenna (IN-2904) on the right. SMA or RP-SMA: In SMA connectors, the terms male and female refer to the male center pin and its female sleeve counterpart. An example of a SMA Antenna is our camera model IN-2904, that has the center pin is on the antenna side - the camera has a male antenna. Reverse polarity SMA (RP-SMA) is a variation of the SMA connector specification which reverses the gender of the interface. The female RP-SMA connector has the same external housing as a standard or conventional female SMA connector, which consists of an outer shell with the threads on the outside BUT the center receptacle is replaced by a male pin. An example for a RP-SMA connector is the Antenna of the camera model IN-3010 - the camera has a female antenna. The image below shows the (female) RP-SMA antenna of a IN-3010 camera on the left and a (male) SMA antenna of a IN-2904 camera on the right. It is advisable to inspect and clean out loose debris from the internal surfaces with compressed air or a gas duster can before mating. A few hundred interconnect cycles are possible if performed carefully. Care should be taken to join connectors straight-on.

One of the most significant technological changes in CCTV market is the advent of so called IP cameras. When choosing security cameras for your home or business, you’ll notice a lot of talk about the differences between analog cameras and IP cameras. Both types of cameras work well in either personal or business security scenarios. An analog camera feeds your security images directly to a television, DVR, or DVD player. An IP, or network, camera feeds your security images directly to a Web server. Despite the fact digital surveillance has been available for quite a few years, there is scant little objective information on what sets them apart from the analog cameras that had powered the industry for decades before. The complexity of what goes into design of IP cameras is partly responsible for this, requiring users to be fluent in everything from advanced video compression to computers and networking. Whether an analog or IP camera is best for you depends upon your individual security needs, so I’m going to list some differences between the two to help you decide on your security camera. Understanding Analog CCTV and IP Cameras: Analog Camera Resolution - As with any imaging device, the analog CCTV camera has a sensor which captures the video image. The resolution of the sensor varies but is limited to a theoretical 720×575 pixel. To get the video out of the CCTV camera into a recording and display device, a single coax cable is used. To maintain compatibility with analog televisions, the signal that comes out of the camera complies with broadcast television standards. The resolution of CCTV cameras are usually specified in the form of lines. The conversion from pixels to lines is very simple. Multiply the horizontal resolution in pixels by 3 and divide by 4 to arrive at number of lines. So for example, if you have 720 pixels in the horizontal dimension, you only have 540 lines of resolution (720 x 3   4 = 540). In this regard, the rating understates the true resolution of the system. The NTSC standard further reduces the maximum amount of lines of resolution to 340 lines (rounding down for simplicity). The camera which advertises 540 lines of resolution, cannot achieve more than 340 once you look at the image that comes out of it over coax. That extra bit of resolution is simply lost as soon as the video leaves the camera. We can translate 340 lines back into pixels - the result is 450 pixels of resolutions (340 x 4   3 = 450). In order to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted, both NTSC and PAL employ a form of video compression called “interlace.” NTSC updates the picture on your display 60 times a second (PAL does so 50 times per second). But instead of sending all of those 450×480 pixels in every instance, the system transmits every other line in each transmission. The actual resolution then in each transmission is 450×240 for NTSC, sent 60 times a second. At the receiving end, we don’t display each transmission separately but rather, combine them into one frame. It is , therefore, important to note that the transmission occurs at 60 images of half vertical resolution, not 30 full resolution frames. The same works for PAL except that the field rate is 50. The result is that camera captures odd and even lines in separate intervals. When we sample the second half-frame 1 60th of a second later, the pixels are no longer lined up. The display then mixes these two and the visual artifact are jagged lines in fast moving Objects like cars. This negative effect can be softened by de-interlacing the analog video signal. The techniques vary based on sophistication and complexity of implementation. One simple technique is averaging those vertical pixels, resulting in softer images but without jaggies. Putting it all together, your analog NTSC camera can have a maximum resolution ranging from 450×240 to 450×480. Total number of pixels therefore ranges from 0.1 megapixels to 0.2 megapixels. No matter what someone tries to do, and how much money they put in the design of the analog TV camera, they cannot improve on this number. Needless to say, the low resolution forces you to be much more careful in camera position and lens selection. A wide angle lens on an analog camera covering a large field, is unlikely to be able to capture detail that is recognizable because the resolution simply is not there. As you see compliance with analog TV standards severely limits what we can do with CCTV cameras. The system works remarkably well for a 50+ year old standard but is nowhere near ideal for an application where recognition of detail (e.g. license plate or someone’s face) is paramount as opposed to enjoyment of a movie or TV programming where fidelity may play second fiddle to the entertainment value. Analog Security Camera Systems: In the traditional analog CCTV application, security cameras capture an analog video signal and transfer that signal over coax cable to the Digital Video Recorder (DVR). Each camera may be powered by plugging in the power supply right at the camera or by using RG59 Siamese cable which bundles the video and the power cables. The DVR converts the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and then stores it on a hard drive for later retrieval. Intelligence is built into the DVR to handle such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom. Monitors for viewing the video are connected to the DVR, or it can be set up to publish over an internal network for viewing on PCs. The DVR can also be set up to broadcast over the Internet and can add password protection and other features. When broadcasting over the Internet, the video for all of the cameras is transmitted as one stream (one IP address). Therefore, it is very efficient. IP Camera Resolution: An IP camera has an image sensor much like the analog camera. However, once it has captured its image, it transmits it as data over a network connection. That data is in the form of compressed video frames sent over standardized networking protocol used for computer applications which is where it gets its name. IP stands for Internet Protocol which is the low-level language used to transmit data between computers in your home and the Internet. What this implies then is that the IP camera is like a little computer that you connect to, to access your video. Indeed, IP cameras are computers and run operating systems not all that different from your PC. The fact that the camera uses IP for transmission is not very important. What is important that we are no longer bound by the broadcast standard (NTSC or PAL). In theory, we could now have any resolution we wanted. By convention, IP cameras are advertize the resolution in megapixels. To arrive at megapixels, simply multiply the horizontal resolution by vertical and divide by one million. If a camera has 1280×720 HD resolution, it would have 0.9 million pixels but this is usually rounded to one megapixels. Full HD relates to a resolution of 1920x1280 pixels, giving you a 2 megapixel camera. So what is the extra resolution good for? For one, it gives you the ability to zoom into the image much more without it turning into a soft and fuzzy image. Detail like a license plate will be much more recognizable at 2 megapixels, versus 0.2. Turning the above upside down, you can choose to have the same resolution but have it cover much wider area, by employing a wideangle lense. The same 2 megapixel camera can cover the same area as three analog cameras and still have more resolution to boot. IP Security Camera Systems: In the IP world, each network camera captures an analog image but immediately converts it to digital inside the camera. Some digital processing can happen right at the camera, such as compression and motion detection. The digital video stream is then broadcast over the local area network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable. Power is supplied to the cameras through the ethernet cable via Power-Over-Ethernet (POE) adapters built into the cameras and at the (POE enabled) switch. The ethernet cable for each camera is plugged into the switch which feeds into the network hub. As with all network devices, some set-up needs to be done for each network camera to set up its IP address and other identifying attributes. A Network Video Recorder (NVR) performs the same function as its DVR cousin in the analog world. It captures each camera s signal, compresses, and records it. The main difference is that the video feeds are digital (and much higher resolution) and not analog. Software built into the NVR provides features such as intelligent search and zoom, etc. The NVR combines the video streams from the cameras and handles the broadcast over the LAN and internet for local and remote viewing. Expense: Let’s talk about budget first, because that is generally a primary concern for anyone looking to install a new security system or enhance an existing one. Analog cameras are cheaper than IP cameras. The technology behind the analog security feed is tried, true, and quite old. This being said, the IP models are generally easier to install than analog units are. They feed the security image directly to Web server, smartphone app or surveillance NAS (e.g. Synology or Qnap.) via an Ethernet cable or a WiFi network - so any wiring you need is likely present in your home or business for your computers. Therefore, the cameras themselves may be more expensive, but the installation and wiring fees for an analog camera just might offset the difference in camera cost should you choose an IP. Which approach is easier to install and configure? If an IP network is already in place at the installation site, and it can handle the additional load of the new cameras, then IP cameras will be easier to install. If additional RJ-45 jacks are needed to plug in the network cameras, then the installer only has to run a CAT-5 cable from the camera to the nearest switch. An inexpensive switch can be installed right at the nearest wall jack. In contrast, each cable for analog cameras must be run all the way back to the DVR. If upgrades need to be made to an existing IP network to handle the additional load, obviously the installation would be more difficult. The power for the cameras can be handled fairly easily with either technology. For IP networks, built in POE adapters make sending the power through the existing Ethernet cable easy. For analog systems, use RG59 Siamese cable to combine the video and power cables into one jacket. Either way, there is no additional cabling for power. POE can run 100 m without a repeater. RG59 can be run 300 m without a repeater. Projection Feed: The security systems you see monitored on TV screens by security guards are generally analog CCTV systems. These cameras are hardwired into a recording device, such as a VCR or DVD recorder, and are constantly recording and projecting the security images onto the TV screen. Cameras on an modern analog CCTV system send their video in the traditional base band format over coax or UTP cabling back to a digital video recorder (DVR). Here, video is digitized and stored on hard drives. Most modern DVRs are a network device, and as such can be accessed remotely from the LAN, or with the proper configuration, from across a WAN or the internet. There are no tapes to change. Video is kept on hard drives, typically on a FIFO basis so there is always a rolling video archive of the past X days. So, despite the fact that video is being transmitted from the cameras in an analog format, live and recorded video is still available over the network. An IP camera system can be hard-wired or wireless, and the image feeds to a network server. IP video cameras broadcast their video as a digital stream over an IP network. Like an analog system, video is recorded on hard drives, but since the video is an IP stream straight from the camera, there is more flexibility as to how and where that video is recorded. The DVR is replaced with an NVR (network video recorder), which in some cases is just software since it doesn t need to convert analog to digital. Video footage can then be stored on network hard drives (NAS - see Synology or Qnap). The server running on your IP camera can be accessed by any electronic device with Internet capabilities - like a PC or Mac (list of compatible software), tablet or smartphone - see iPhone/iPad app, Android app and Windows Phone app. Data Security: Analog security camera is feeding the images directly into a recording device. This makes your security feed susceptible to anyone with the capabilities of getting their hands on your tapes, DVDs, or recording units. An IP security camera can upload it´s footage to the internet - you can directly record the video stream from a different site or upload alarm triggered video recordings or snapshots to an internet FTP server. Therefore, if you are concerned about the security of your recordings, you’ll probably feel more comfortable with an IP security system than an analogue one. How does an IP Camera work: Video Compression - Uncompressed video takes considerable amount of data to store and transmit. Luckily, frames of video themselves have a lot of redundancy in them as do sequence of frames. Take a blue sky. Chances are a lot of pixels are the same and can be described using fewer bits of data. We call this intraframe compression. JPEG is a form of intraframe compression. Send a sequence of JPEG frames and we call that Motion JPEG or M-JPEG for short. JPEG is very cheap to implement and hence the reason it is universally offered in IP cameras. Another form of compression is interframe compression. This takes advantage of redundancy between frames. MPEG-2, MPEG-4, H.264 (also called MPEG-4 Part 10 or MPEG-4 AVC), and VC-1 are popular compression standards of this type. At high level, these systems perform a similar function to JPEG in compressing an individual frame. But they also look to see if the current frame is similar to the one before it. If so, then they only transmit what is different and the decoder combines that information with the previous frame to display the image. For example, imagine a person walking in front of a building. The building is not changing in every frame. The only thing changing is the pixels describing the person moving. The above systems divide the screen into blocks and then track whether each block moves. If it has, it then tells the decoder to move that square, rather than having to retransmit the whole image. The decoder holds on to the previous frame(s) in order to be able to perform this processing . The amount of compression is not predictable and is picture dependent. A static image achieves the highest level of compression. A noisy night-time image with lots of motion will probably be the lowest. While a scheme like JPEG can provide 10 to 20 times data reduction without a lot of fidelity loss, systems using MPEG-4 AVC can ratchet this up to 50 or even 100 times compression. Networking: Once the video image compressed, we need to transmit it where it is going to be viewed or stored. The favorite method of physical connection is an Ethernet port. And with advent of Power over Ethernet (PoE), IP cameras can be powered using the same Ethernet wire. Analog camera systems transmit over coax, not the LAN, so their bandwidth is not much of an issue. The only use of the LAN in analog systems is for the DVR to broadcast video data over the network to local desktop users or to the internet. DVRs tend to broadcast video very efficiently and will only use bandwidth if people are currently viewing the cameras. In IP camera systems on the other hand, each IP camera uses the LAN to broadcast their signal to the NVR so bandwidth can be a big issue. An IP camera set to a 320 x 176 resolution, 30 frames per second (30 fps), and MPEG4 compression will require about 720K bits per second (720Kbps). Therefore, if we put 100 IP cameras running CIF on a network, we would use about 72Mbps of bandwidth. This number will double if audio is also transmitted. However, to make bandwidth matters worse for IP - most of the newest IP cameras are coming out with 'megapixel' resolution. This is wonderful from the standpoint of how much clarity and field-of-view can be captured, but it comes at a huge price to bandwidth. A single 2-megapixel IP camera, running 30 fps with MPEG4 compression will use a whopping 6.5Mbps of bandwidth. It should come as no surprise then that some companies have gone so far as to create an entirely separate IP network just to run their camera system. Modern IP cameras provide a range of interfaces to extract the video from them. The simplest form is an included web server in the camera which you can connect to using any browser and view videos directly Web User Interface. While operating in the browser provides broad level of compatibility, it can be limiting from functionality point of view. For this reason, camera companies also provide plug-ins called “ActiveX controls” in Windows lingo, which are little applications that know how to talk to the camera. Many cameras have the ability to upload their videos directly to a networked storage device, whether this is a NAS (Networked Attached Storage - e.g. Synology or Qnap) or a PC server Software. They can email you select video frames, or “ftp” video recordings to an Internet server. On the control front, that is done through software. Instead of running wires to control the functions of a PTZ camera, you would use the software interface to send the same commands to the camera, saving wiring costs. IP Wireless Security Camera System: Analog wireless systems do not work well. This is because the government regulates on which frequencies analog wireless devices can run and how strong the signal can be. Interference from other wireless devices such as cell phones can cause the camera video to be distorted. Interference is especially problematic in buildings with florescent lighting. Digital IP wireless is much better. The digital transmission does not get interference from other analog wireless devices, and the 802.11x communication standard used has encryption built in. Consequently, there is no problem with unauthorized access to the video. IP Wireless security camera system design is very similar to standard IP camera system design except for the addition of wireless access points inserted between the home network switch and the cameras.","link": "/Advanced_User/CCTV_vs_IP", "title2": "IP oder CCTV", "chapter": "Advanced User","tags": ["IP camera", "CCTV", "analog", "digital", "NTSC", "PAL", "Security Cameras", "Surveillance", "Ethernet", "Compression"],"image": "/images/Search/InstarWiki_SearchThumb_IPvsCCTV.jpg","abstract": "Difference Between Analog And IP Cameras" ,"suggest" : {"input": ["IP camera", "CCTV", "analog", "digital", "NTSC", "PAL", "Security Cameras", "Surveillance", "Ethernet", "Compression"], "output": "SMA or RP-SMA Antennas", "payload" : { "articleId" : 1233 },"weight" : 1}}

Video Plugins: All INSTAR HD cameras can display their video stream inside a modern web browser (like Firefox, Chrome or Edge) without the need for a video plugin. Just activate the MJPEG mode for this - e.g. in the Multimedia/Video Menu of your 720p camera. But you will loose the h.264 video compression and might start to suffer from bandwidth bottlenecks inside your network. We hightly recommend, that you should install the Flash Video Plugin and use the h.264 videostream instead. This plugin is already installed on most systems and your camera is configured to use it by default - you should be able to see the video stream at once, after loading your cameras web user interface. Other Options: If for some reason you cannot use the Flash Video Plugin, there are three more options to display the video stream inside a web browser. You can use the Quick Time Plugin, an ActiveX Plugin (only works with Internet Explorer and Firefox) that comes with a couple of perks or use the above mentioned MJPEG mode to avoid using plugins all together. ActiveX Plugin -  Windows video plugin (IE and FF). QuickTime Plugin - Plugin for Windows and macOS. MJPEG Mode - Use this mode in Microsoft Edge.

What is the difference between IN-LAN 500 & IN-LAN 500p? The P in IN-LAN 500p stands for pass-through. Unlike the base model the 500p will block your power outlet but pass through the existing one. Both models offer the same advantages otherwise: Use existing power lines to implement a network with IN-LAN. Very simple plug&play technology. Just plug into the wall socket and you re done. Ultra-fast data transfer up to 500Mbps. Expand your network with for e.g. IP cameras without laying network cables. A very detailed instruction will make the installation very easy. IN-LAN 500 White The IN-LAN 500 Powerline Adapter - Create a Network Connection over your Power Grid. IN-LAN 500p White The IN-LAN 500p Powerline Pass-Through Adapter - Create a Network Connection over your Power Grid. IN-LAN 500p Black The IN-LAN 500p Powerline Pass-Through Adapter - Starter Kits with up to 4 Adapter. IN-LAN Powerline Communication What is IN-LAN? IN-LAN is an intelligent and secure technology that lets you set up a home network easily via your household power grid - without the need of complex and expensive dedicated cabling. IN-LAN communication now attains speeds you would expect from other LAN technologies. IN-LAN uses the household power grid to transfer data between computers equipped with suitable adapters and other network components. As a result, any power outlet can be used as a network access point. State-of-the-art technology ensures that the power and data networks do not interfere with one another. The IN-LAN 500p passes through the power from the used outlet - use the 500p if you don t have enough outlets and don t want one to be blocked by the powering adapter. What does INSTAR IN-LAN offer? IN-LAN offers a PLC transfer rate of up to 500Mbps (effective rate 65Mbps TCP 90 Mbps UDP) with a range of up to 150m which makes it ideal for applications with high bandwidth requirements, such as IP cameras, HD video streaming, VoIP and fast Internet access. Connecting your IN-LAN adapter to an electrical outlet transforms the home-based electrical system into a fast network with high data throughput with maximum data security using the powerful 128-bit AES encryption. Simply press the Pair Button on the IN-LAN adapter or use the Atheros configuration wizard to set up custom encryption for your network. Whether in the office or at home - connect all your LAN devices without the need of an additional LAN cable. How to connect your IN-LAN adaptor to the network ? Simply plug one IN-LAN adaptor into a power socket next to your broadband router and connect the adaptor to your router via the supplied Ethernet cable. Plug the second IN-LAN unit into an outlet - for example - close to your INSTAR camera and connect the camera to your network using the cameras Ethernet cable. Powerline Networks How to build a public network? The data communication via the household power grid is encrypted to ensure your privacy. You can activate the protected communication between two adaptors (once they are both connected to an outlet) by simply pushing the Pairing Button next to the Ethernet port. Press the Pairing Button of one adaptor for more than 10 seconds to restart it. Then press each Pairing Button for 3-8 seconds to pair both adaptors. That’s it - the IN-LAN Indicator lights up and the IN-LAN adaptor network is now protected from unauthorized access. If you have already secured existing IN-LAN adaptor using the Pairing Button, use the same method to integrate further adaptors. To do so, press the Pairing Button of one of your network’s existing adaptors (3-8 seconds), then press the Pairing Button of your new IN-LAN adaptor (3-8 seconds). That’s it - the new adaptor is now integrated in your network. To integrate additional adaptors into your network, please repeat the steps above. To exclude one IN-LAN adaptor from an existing network, press its Pairing Button for more than 10 seconds. The device will be assigned with a new random encryption key and will no longer be able to access the network. To integrate the adaptor into a different IN-LAN adaptor network, follow the steps described above. How to build a private network? Please plug in one IN-LAN Adapter to the power socket next to your router and connect it with the supplied network cable with a free Ethernet port. If you install and open the Power Packet Utility (which is included on the CD of your IN-LAN adapter) you should be able to see the IN-LAN adapter as a Local Device(s) together with the MAC address of the adapter. Please choose the adapter and select the tab Privacy. In Private Network Name you can now see the network name encryption with which the adapters are communicating between each other. Replace the Private Network Name with a password you want to use. Please notice that this password will be the one, with which the adapters are communicating. If you buy a new adapter, you need to set the same password in order to integrate it into the existing IN-LAN network. Next please click Set Local Device Only to submit the password and sent it to the IN-LAN adapter. In the upcoming window please click OK. This message tells you that the password was set successfully. Repeat this step for all existing IN-LAN Adapters. This way all adapters get set to the same private network in order to communicate with each other. After you have set the second adapter, as shown above, you can plug it in to a power socket near the device you want to connect with your network. The IN-LAN adapter should then be shown in the list together with the signal strength. (see below) Important: We recommend to always test the connection between the adapters by connecting them to power outlets near each other. If the connection is ok you can connect one adapter next to the device you want to use it. This way you can make sure that the adapters are working correctly. If the adapter does not work at the final installation place, either the quality of the power line is not ok or the power line might have a lot of noise which disturbs the signal of the IN-LAN adapters - e.g fuse boxes or heavy machinery connected to a power outlet in the same grid can make it impossible to establish a powering connection. How to change the password for a private network This step shows you how to change the encryption for all adapters at the same time in case you want to change it for your existing network. Therefore please select one of the connected adapters and select Enter Password. Type in the hardware key that you can find on your IN-LAN adapter or on the package of each adapter. It is important that you check if the MAC address is matching the adapters address. After typing in the key (case sensitive) you can submit it. If everything is correct it should accept the new password. Select OK and the hardware key will be sent. You can now go to Privacy to change the encryption for your adapters. Now fill in the new password and press Set All Devices. By doing so all adapters will be set to the new encryption.","link": "/Products/IN-LAN", "title2": "INSTAR IN-LAN 500", "chapter": "INSTAR Products","tags": ["IN-LAN", "500p", "products", "500", "powerline", "network", "devolo", "homeplug AV"],"image": "http://placehold.it/594x380","abstract": "Powerline Network Communication" ,"suggest" : {"input": ["IN-LAN", "500p", "products", "500", "powerline", "network", "devolo", "homeplug AV"], "output": "Powerline Network Communication", "payload" : { "articleId" : 1272 },"weight" : 1}}

Please make sure that your battery is fully charged by pressing the Battery Indicator button - 4 LEDs means the Powerbank is filled and ready to go. Now push the power slider into the third position, indicated by the WiFi symbol. The IN-Route will now start up the router - please wait a moment for it boot. You can check the Indicator LED on top of the device - once the router is ready for operation both of them - the blue and the green one - will be on, turning the light into a turquoise colour. Shortly after that you will see the IN-Route´s Wifi network pop up in your computer´s or mobile device´s WiFi list. Charge your Powerbank, check the Battery Indicator and then push the power slider in the WiFi position (the one with the WiFi symbol). How to Login to your IN-Route P52 Router Star up your computer or mobile device and check the list of available WiFi networks. The IN-Route´s default WiFi name (SSID) is IN-Route P52. Make sure that you check that your device is going to connect to the IN-Route automatically, as you might have to restart the router several times during the initial setup and this will save you the trouble from reconnecting manually. Please make sure that your device is configured to receive an IP address automatically from the router (DHCP) before you connect. If you are unsure what the configuration of your device is, it is most likely configured correctly and you can proceed. But just keep this in mind - if you can connect to the router but you cannot open the web user interface, it might just be that the DHCP service on your computer is deactivated. The default key for the WiFi network is: WiFi Key = 12345678 Choose the IN-Route network and connect to it with your computer or mobile device. Once the WiFi connection has been established, open your default web browser and type the routers IP into the address bar. The default IP is http:  192.168.169.1 and you can skip the http:   prefix with most browsers. As far as I collect it, only the Internet Explorer demands it. So typing in 192.168.169.1 and pressing enter will call the router s web user interface and confront you with a login prompt. The default login is: Username = admin Password = instar Now type http:  192.168.169.1 into your browsers address bar to open the web user interface. The default login for the IN-Route P52 is admin and the password is instar. You will now be presented with the router´s web user interface that allows you to configure the device to your personal needs. Please follow the links below the screenshot for further information on how to configure the router for specific tasks. But the good news is, if you just connect the router to a LAN cable, that is connected to a internet router - you are already done creating your own personal access point (AP). The IN-Route will automatically switch into an AP mode and give you access to the internet. So next time you are staying in a hotel room that only offers a LAN cable for internet access and everything you brought is your iPad - well, you are in luck now. Switch on the IN-Route, wait for it to boot, connect it to LAN cable and connect your iPad to the IN-Route´s WiFi network. Done - problem solved! But please be aware that it might take a few minutes for the router to negotiate the access. You will now be greeted by the router´s Home Screen to begin the configuration.","link": "/Products/IN-Route/First_Steps/Login", "title2": "IN-Route P52 :: Login", "chapter": "INSTAR Products","tags": ["IN-Route", "Mobile Router", "Powerbank", "Access Point", "Wireless Router", "3G Router"],"image": "http://placehold.it/594x380","abstract": "Login to your Router" ,"suggest" : {"input": [ "IN-Route", "Mobile Router", "Powerbank", "Access Point", "Wireless Router", "3G Router" ], "output": "IN-Route P52 :: Login", "payload" : { "articleId" : 1277 },"weight" : 1}}

This sensor is the perfect extension for your ip camera in order to minimize false alarms. While the camera is using a software based motion detection which compares each picture (frame) with each other to identify a motion, the PIR detector is only detecting humans or bigger animals which will release heat from the bodys. This way a tree which is moving in the wind or light which gets turned on and off will not cause an alarm of your ip camera. The IN-MOTION motion detector will not detect this kind of movment as an alarm which will lower the amount of false alarms enormously.The scope of the delivery sums up everything you will need to use the sensor with your INSTAR IP camera (as long as the camera model comes with an Alarm I O - please check the cameras technical specification): 1x IN-MOTION 300 1x 4m signal cable 1x power supply (12V   3A) with 3m cable 1x set of dowls and screws 1x installation manual IN-Motion 300 The IN-Motion 300 PIR Motion Detector for indoor IP Cameras. How does a motion detector work What is PIR? PIR stands for Passive Infrared or Pyroelectric Infrared. PIR sensors can be defined as detectors of warm-bodied targets in motion. A stationary target can not be detected. To detect a moving target, the target must have a surface temperature that is substantially different than the surrounding ambient temperature. Although the usual targets of a PIR detector are warm-bodied (mammals, birds), the PIR sensor will also detect a moving target that has a surface temperature that is significantly lower than the ambient temperature. As long as the target is large enough, and its surface temperature is detectably different than the ambient (higher or lower) - and the target is moving - it can be detected by a PIR sensor. Main Features of the IN-Motion 300 Internal logic control to avoid false alarms Auto temperature compensation Pulse count adjustment White light interference compensation RF interference comp. (20V m-1GHz) Wide angle Fresnel lense Ceiling installation Alarm output N.C. N.O. IN-Motion 300 The IN-Motion 300 - A powerful and inconspicuous camera companion. General Considerations Temperatures can often change dramatically in relatively short times. Large temperature changes can render the PIR sensor either more, or less, sensitive. As ambient temperatures rise to near 37ºC, the difference between the target and ambient temperature decreases - and the sensitivity of the sensor declines. As temperatures decrease the opposite is true and the sensor becomes more sensitive. As target and ambient temperatures become equal, the PIR sensor may no longer be able to detect a target. Large targets usually have enough variation in their surface temperature to allow the sensor to detect them - even when the ambient temperature is the same as their average body temperature. The IN-Motion PIR sensors compensate the PIR detector sensitivity according to the ambient temperature. This allows you to utilize the full range of the sensors capabilities - whenever and wherever they are needed! How do I install the IN-Motion 300 IN-Motion 300 These are the components of the IN-Motion 300 PIR motion detector. Component Function 1 Relay Jumper Allows you to set the relay to “Normally Open” (1&2) or “Normally Closed” (2&3). In NC mode an interruption in the connection to the sensor, e.g. when it is damaged, will lead to an alarm. NC is the standard mode. 2 Alarm Indicator Jumper Set the Jumper to the pins 2&3 to deactivate the red alarm indicator LED (see 7, below). 3 Tamper Switch Reserved holes for screw mounting (Recommended to use bracket mouting). 4 Connection Terminal Connector for the 12V power supply + alarm output. 5 Pulse Compensation Jumper In case your sensor triggers too many false alarms, please adjust the sensors sensitivity - Jumper on Pin 1&2 equals a high sensitivity, 2&3 an average sensitivity and removing the jumper leads to a low sensitivity. 6 IR Sensor Dual element pyroelectric detector. 7 Alarm Indicator The red shows LED the alarm state of the sensor. How do I connect it to my IP Camera ? IN-Motion 300 The camera´s alarm I O consists of 4 pins - 1&2 are the alarm output and 3&4 are the alarm input. Use the pins 3&4 for (potential-free) sensor devices you want to use to trigger the camera´s alarm. The IN-Motion PIR Sensor is already connected to the power plug and the alarm output cable. Simply connect the signal cable to your INSTAR cameras alarm input connector. The image below shows the I O bridge of IN-3005 3010 or 3011 - choose the ports 3 & 4 for the sensor cable and replug the bridge into the cameras I O connector. IN-Motion 300 These are the components of the IN-Motion 300 PIR motion detector. The alarm input of your camera might look different depending on your camera model. Please refer to your user manual to identify the correct ports. You may choose either polarity when connecting the cable. After connecting the PIR sensor with your camera’s signal input, please open the camera’s web user interface. Go to the alarm settings and activate the external alarm input. Depending on how you set up your sensor (N.C. or N.O.) choose the Relay Position (HD cameras)   Trigger Level (VGA cameras) accordingly. In practical terms that means - choose the value that doesn´t cause you a continuous alarm trigger even if nothing is happening in front of the sensor. You can use the IN-Motions alarm LED (red alarm indicator should light up when triggered, see table above 7) to test if the sensor is working. Testing it in it´s place of installation will allow you to adjust it to a suitable sensitivity. Triggering the PIR sensor should now trigger an alarm event inside of the camera. The trigger event will be treated just like an internal motion detection event by the camera. So all the settings in place for an alarm event (video recording, email notification, ftp upload, etc) can be triggered by the PIR sensor from now on.

The Microwave unit works by the principle of Doppler radar. A continuous wave of microwave radiation is emitted, and phase shifts in the reflected microwaves due to motion of an object toward (or away from) the receiver result in a heterodyne signal. Passive infrared sensors are sensitive to a person s skin temperature through emitted radiation at mid-infrared wavelengths, in contrast to background objects at room temperature. No energy is emitted from the sensor, thus the name passive infrared (PIR). In order for motion to be detected, both sensors must trip together. The combination of both techniques lowers the probability of a false alarm since heat and sunlight changes may trip the PIR but not the microwave, while moving trees in the background may trigger the microwave unit but not the PIR. The scope of delivery contains all the components you need to connect the detector with your INSTAR IP camera. The sensor is rated to be weatherproof - but please be aware that you will have to seal the cable entry point if you want to install the detector in an area that is heavily exposed to the weather.

A separate indoor power supply, a wall mount with dowels and screws and a 5m extension cable to connect the sensor with your camera. The long cable allows you to bring your detector close to the area you are monitoring. Or to make good use of a chocking point in the terrain everyone has to pass through before reaching the area that is in view of the camera. IN-Motion 500 Usermanual IN-Motion 500 Sensor How does the Dual Sensor work? All methods of intrusion detection have their downfalls. The solution to this problem combine them and have one method take over when the other is failing. Regular heat detectors (PIRs) work best in a cold environment, preferably at night (no interference from sun light) and when the intruder passes in front of the sensor. They can be fooled when the intruder masks his body heat. Or when the background temperature is close to body temperature. A false positive detection, on the other hand, can be cause by rising hot air above a surface that is being heated by sunshine. Microwave detectors are emitting waves that are deflected by obstacles in their path. Reflected waves are then registered by a second antenna inside the sensor and changes in the reflection - caused by new objects - detected. There is very little interference with heat and sunlight and the detector also works if an intruder is walking straight towards the sensor. These two types of sensors complement each other with one more sensitive in the area where the other is less sensitive. IN-Motion 500 Setup Setup your IN-Motion 500 for Operation Before using your IN-Motion in combination with your INSTAR camera, you first have to connect it to the sensor cable, choose whether you want to use it in N.C. or N.O. configuration and adjust the sensitivity of both sensors. Additionally, you can either use both sensors in OR or AND mode. In the first case, it is sufficient that one sensor detects something to trigger an alert inside your camera. This is the optimal mode if one sensor is inhibited in the environment you are using your sensor - e.g. in a very hot environment the PIR sensor can become unreliable since the difference in background and body temperature becomes negligible. The AND should be used if you are receiving too many false-positive alerts due to false detections by one of the sensors. IN-Motion 500 Wiring Connect the IN-Motion 500 with your INSTAR Camera Once your IN-Motion is set up, the rest of the installation becomes very easy. Mount the sensor on a wall or ceiling and plug in the power supply. Now connect the end of the sensor cable with your camera´s Alarm-IN. The Alarm-IN connector is either situated at the cable tree of your outdoor camera, or in the base of the camera case, of your indoor camera. Please check your camera´s user manual for the exact location. Remark: Not all camera models come with an alarm relay. Please make sure that your camera supports external sensors before buying the IN-Motion 500. IN-Motion 500 WebUI IP Camera WebUI Setting Depending on the way you wired up your sensor in the earlier step, you have to choose the correct operation mode inside your camera´s web user interface. Please open the interface inside your web browser and navigate to Alarm Actions to activate the relay and choose whether you operate it in N.O. or N.C. mode. If you choose to use the PIR and MW sensor in the OR configuration (see above), it is recommended to couple the camera´s internal software based motion detection with the external trigger (only available for HD cameras). Otherwise, you can deactivate the camera´s internal detection. IN-Motion 500 Considerations Considerations As partly already mentioned earlier, there are many factors that affect the sensitivity and accuracy of both sensors. It is important that you plan ahead, where you install the sensor and what kind of interferences you are expecting. Do you need the maximum sensitivity to catch the even the slightest movement - even if this means that you will also receive false alerts? Or do you want to couple the sensors and maybe reduce their sensitivity to make sure that your camera is only triggered when both sensors detected a motion? IN-Motion 500 External Recording External Recording Devices Using an external motions sensor will give you a much better result in your alarm recordings. All Software based motion detection is prone to false alerts due to changes in lighting or general wheather conditions, like rain, snow or fog. Surveillance Solutions, as offered by, e.g., QNAP or Synology, provide a superior software based motion detection. But they still can´t match the accuracy of a hardware sensor, operating in unison with your surveillance camera. Those systems, therefore, offer the option to use the external sensor as the alarm trigger - instead of relying on their internal detection.","link": "/Products/IN-Motion/500", "title2": "INSTAR IN-Motion 500", "chapter": "INSTAR Products","tags": ["Motion Detection", "Passive Infrared", "PIR", "Microwave", "IN-Motion", "Dual Sensor", "500"],"image": "http://placehold.it/594x380","abstract": "Passive Infrared and Microwave Motion Detectiont" ,"suggest" : {"input": [ "Motion Detection", "Passive Infrared", "PIR", "Microwave", "IN-Motion", "Dual Sensor", "500" ], "output": "INSTAR IN-Motion 500", "payload" : { "articleId" : 1284 },"weight" : 1}}
